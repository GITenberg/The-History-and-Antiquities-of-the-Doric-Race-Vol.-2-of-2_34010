1. Before we speak of the form of government
which prevailed in the Doric states, it will be necessary
to set aside all modern ideas respecting the origin,
essence, and object of a state; namely, that it is an
institution for protecting the persons and property of
the individuals contained in it. We shall approach
nearer to the ancient notion, if we consider the essence
of a state to be, that by a recognition of the same opinions
and principles, and the direction of actions to the
same ends, the whole body become, as it were, one
moral agent. Such an unity of opinions and actions
can only be produced by the ties of some natural
affinity, such as of a nation, a tribe, or a part of one:
although in process of time the meaning of the terms
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">state</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nation</span></em> became more distinct. The more
complete the unity of feelings and principles is, the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page002">[pg 002]</span><a name="Pg002" id="Pg002" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
more vigorous will be the common exertions, and the
more comprehensive the notion of the state. As this
was in general carried to a wider extent among the
Greeks than by modern nations, so it was perhaps nowhere
so strongly marked as in the Dorian states,
whose national views with regard to political institutions
were most strongly manifested in the government
of Sparta. Here the plurality of the persons composing
the state was most completely reduced to unity;
and hence the life of a Spartan citizen was chiefly concerned
in public affairs. The greatest freedom of the
Spartan, as well as of the Greeks in general, was only
to be a living member of the body of the state;
whereas that which in modern times commonly receives
the name of liberty, consists in having the
fewest possible claims from the community; or in
other words, in dissolving the social union to the
greatest degree possible, as far as the individual is
concerned. What the Dorians endeavoured to obtain
in a state was good order, or κόσμος, the regular
combination of different elements. The expression of
king Archidamus in Thucydides,<a id="noteref_1" name="noteref_1" href="#note_1"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1</span></span></a> that <span class="tei tei-q">“it is most
honourable, and at the same time most secure, for
many persons to show themselves obedient to the
same order (κόσμος),”</span> was a fundamental principle
of this race. And hence the Spartans honoured
Lycurgus so greatly, as having instituted the existing
order of things (κόσμος):<a id="noteref_2" name="noteref_2" href="#note_2"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2</span></span></a> and called his son by the
laudatory title of Eucosmus.<a id="noteref_3" name="noteref_3" href="#note_3"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3</span></span></a> For the same reason
the supreme magistrate among the Cretans was called
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page003">[pg 003]</span><a name="Pg003" id="Pg003" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Cosmus; among the Epizephyrian Locrians, Cosmopolis.
Thus this significant word expresses the spirit of
the Dorian government, as well as of the Dorian music
and philosophy.<a id="noteref_4" name="noteref_4" href="#note_4"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">4</span></span></a>
With this desire to obtain a complete
uniformity, an attempt after stability is necessarily
connected. For an unity of this kind having
been once established, the next object is to remove
whatever has a tendency to destroy it, and to repress
all causes which may lead to a change: yet an attempt
to exclude all alteration is never completely successful:
partly on account of the internal changes which
take place in the national character, and partly because
causes operating from without necessarily produce
some modifications. These states, however, endeavour
to retain unchanged a state of things once established
and approved; while others, in which from
the beginning the opinions of individuals have out-weighed
the authority of the whole, admit, in the
progress of time, of greater variety, and more innovations,
readily take up whatever is offered to them by
accident of time and place, or even eagerly seek for
opportunities of change. States of this description
must soon lose all firmness and character, and fall to
pieces from their own weakness; while those which
never admit of innovation will at last, after having
long stood as ruins in a foreign neighbourhood, yield
to the general tide of human affairs, and their destruction
is commonly preceded by the most complete
anarchy.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. This description expresses, though perhaps too
forcibly, the difference between the Doric and Ionic
races. The former had, of all the Grecians, the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page004">[pg 004]</span><a name="Pg004" id="Pg004" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
greatest veneration for antiquity; and not to degenerate
from his ancestors was the strongest exhortation
which a Spartan could hear:<a id="noteref_5" name="noteref_5" href="#note_5"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">5</span></span></a> the latter, on the
other hand, were in everything fond of novelty, and
delighted in foreign communication; whence their
cities were always built on the sea, whereas the
Dorians generally preferred an inland situation. The
anxiety of the Dorians, and the Spartans in particular,
to keep up the pure Doric character and the customs
of their ancestors, is strongly shown by the prohibition
to travel,<a id="noteref_6" name="noteref_6" href="#note_6"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">6</span></span></a>
and the exclusion of foreigners, an institution
common both to the Spartans and Cretans,
and which has been much misrepresented by ancient
authors.<a id="noteref_7" name="noteref_7" href="#note_7"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">7</span></span></a> It is very possible, as Plutarch thinks,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page005">[pg 005]</span><a name="Pg005" id="Pg005" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that the severity of these measures was increased by
the decline of all morals and discipline, which had
arisen among the Ionians from the contrary practice;
that race having in the earliest times fallen into a
state of the greatest effeminacy and inactivity, from
their connexion with their Asiatic neighbours. For
how early was the period when the ancient constitution
of the Grecian family degenerated among the Ionians
into the slavery of the wife! how weak, effeminate,
and luxurious do their ancient poets Callinus<a id="noteref_8" name="noteref_8" href="#note_8"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">8</span></span></a>
and Asius<a id="noteref_9" name="noteref_9" href="#note_9"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">9</span></span></a> represent them! and if the legend describes
even the daughters of Neleus, the founder of the
colony, as completely destitute of morality,<a id="noteref_10" name="noteref_10" href="#note_10"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">10</span></span></a> what must
have been the condition of this people, when the wives
of the Ionians had mixed with Lydian women! The
warning voice of such examples might well stimulate
the ancient lawgivers to draw in with greater closeness
the iron bond of custom.

3. But with all this difference in the races of

which the Grecian nation consisted, there was, in the
development of the constitutions of the Greek states,
a common progress, which extended a certain influence
even to such as retained their earlier impressions
with a firm adherence to antiquity. As it is
our present object to give a general view of this advance,
we will begin with the constitution of the
heroic age, so clearly described in Homer. This can
scarcely be called by any other name than that of
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">aristocracy</span></em>, as its most important feature is the accurate
division between the nobles<a id="noteref_11" name="noteref_11" href="#note_11"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">11</span></span></a> and the people.
The former composed the deliberative councils, and
the courts of justice;<a id="noteref_12" name="noteref_12" href="#note_12"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">12</span></span></a>
and although both were commonly
combined with a public assembly (ἀγορὰ), the
nobles were the only persons who proposed measures,
deliberated and voted; the people was only present
in order to hear the debate, and to express its feelings
as a body; which expressions might then be noticed
by princes of a mild disposition.<a id="noteref_13" name="noteref_13" href="#note_13"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">13</span></span></a> The chief ruler
himself was properly of equal rank with the other
nobles, and was only raised above them by the authority
intrusted to him as president in the council, and
commander in the field. This form of government
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page007">[pg 007]</span><a name="Pg007" id="Pg007" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
continued to exist for a considerable time in the
Ionian, Achæan, and Æolian states; but the power
of the chief ruler gradually declined, and was at last
wholly abolished. With the Dorians, however, the
case was very different; they were peculiar in possessing
a very limited nobility, for the Heraclidæ had
nearly an exclusive right to that appellation: while,
on the other hand, a whole nation occupied by means
of conquest, a station analogous to that of an aristocracy,
uniting military pursuits with independence
obtained by the possession of the land.

4. About the 30th Olympiad (660 B.C.), however,
on account of the increased trade and intercourse
with foreign nations, and consequently of the greater
demand for luxuries, the value of wealth rose in comparison
with the honour of noble descent. The land,
indeed, still remained for the most part in the hands of
the aristocracy; but as it had at this time become more
easy to dissipate an inherited estate, and to obtain consideration
by the profits of trade, property was more
exposed to sudden changes. It is probable that the
Geomori of the Ionic Samos, as well as the Hippobotæ
of Chalcis (which, as well as Samos, had once
belonged to Ionians), whose distinction was derived
from the possession of land, also carried on the extensive
commerce of these two states; otherwise the
wealth of the merchant would soon have exceeded that
of the landowner. In the Doric states also, which
were much engaged in trade, such as Corinth, Ægina,
&amp;c., it was attempted to unite the government of hereditary
aristocracy and of wealth.<a id="noteref_14" name="noteref_14" href="#note_14"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">14</span></span></a> The new importance
attached to wealth, even at the time of the Seven
Sages, gave rise to the saying of Aristodemus the Argive,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page008">[pg 008]</span><a name="Pg008" id="Pg008" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“Money makes the man;”</span><a id="noteref_15" name="noteref_15" href="#note_15"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">15</span></span></a> and at a later period
Theognis the Megarean complains that the pursuit of
riches confounds all distinction of rank, and that estimation
was derived from it.<a id="noteref_16" name="noteref_16" href="#note_16"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">16</span></span></a> The ancient legislators
of Greece considered the power of money, or moveable
property (which is as changeable as property in land
is durable), most prejudicial to the safety of states;
and they endeavoured by oppressing the commercial
classes, as well as by rendering the land inalienable, to
palliate a danger which they were unable wholly to
remove. Sparta alone, from the unchangeableness of
her institutions, remained free from these revolutions.
Solon, on the other hand, endeavoured to arrest and
perpetuate a state of things which was merely fleeting
and transitory. He left some remnants of the aristocracy,
particularly the political union of the γένεα, or
houses, untouched; while he made his government in
principle a timocracy, the amount of property determining
the share in the governing power; and at the
same time showed a democratic tendency in the low
rate at which he fixed the valuation. In his poetry
also Solon considers the middle ranks as most valuable
to the state; and therefore he endeavoured to give them
political importance.<a id="noteref_17" name="noteref_17" href="#note_17"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">17</span></span></a> But the temperature which he
chose was too artificial to be lasting; and the constitution
of Solon, in its chief points, only remained in force
for a few years. In other Ionic states also similar reconciliations
were attempted, but without obtaining
any stability.<a id="noteref_18" name="noteref_18" href="#note_18"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">18</span></span></a> The spirit of the age was manifestly
turned towards democracy; and though at Athens
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page009">[pg 009]</span><a name="Pg009" id="Pg009" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Solon, as being the friend of the people, succeeded
perhaps in effecting a more gradual transition; in
other places the parties were more directly opposed, as
is clearly shown by the contest between the parties
Πλοῦτις and Χειρομάχα at Miletus.<a id="noteref_19" name="noteref_19" href="#note_19"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">19</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
5. At Athens however, and generally throughout
Greece, the first result of these democratic movements
was the establishment of tyranny or despotism; which
may be considered as a violent revulsion, destined to
precede a complete subversion of all the existing institutions.
It has been already shown that the tyrants
of Corinth, Sicyon, Megara, and Epidaurus, were
originally leaders of the popular party against the
Doric nobility, or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">demagogues</span></em>, according to the expression
of Aristotle; and for this reason Sparta, as
being the protector of aristocracy, overthrew them,
wherever her power extended.<a id="noteref_20" name="noteref_20" href="#note_20"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">20</span></span></a> In Ionia and
Sicily the tyrants found an oligarchical timocracy, which was
commonly opposed by a democratical party;<a id="noteref_21" name="noteref_21" href="#note_21"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">21</span></span></a> and in
some instances, as in that of Gelon, the tyrant acted
against the popular faction. At the time of the
Persian war democracy had struck deep root among
the Ionians; and Mardonius the Persian, after the
expulsion of the tyrants, restored it in their cities as
the desired form of government.<a id="noteref_22" name="noteref_22" href="#note_22"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">22</span></span></a> In Athens Cleisthenes
had deprived the union of the houses (the last
support of the aristocracy) of its political importance;
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page010">[pg 010]</span><a name="Pg010" id="Pg010" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and Aristides was at length compelled by circumstances
to change the timocracy into a democracy.
For in the Persian invasion the lower orders had discovered,
while serving as rowers and sailors in the
fleet, how much the safety of the state depended upon
their exertions, and would no longer submit to be excluded
from a share in the highest offices.<a id="noteref_23" name="noteref_23" href="#note_23"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">23</span></span></a> The
democracy flourished so long as great men understood
how to guide it by the imposing superiority of their
individual characters, and educated persons (οἱ βελτίονες)
dared to take a share in public affairs; it fell
when the greedy and indolent people, allured by the
prospect of rewards pernicious to the state, filled the
public assemblies and courts of justice. We will not
carry on any further our picture of the ochlocracy, in
which all social union was entirely dissolved, and the
state was surrendered to the arbitrary will of a turbulent
populace.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
6. The last of these changes, produced by what is
called the spirit of the times, we have illustrated by the
history of Athens, although the same course may be
shown to have taken place in other, even originally
Doric states. Thus in Ambracia, about the same time
as at Athens, the timocracy gradually passed into a
democracy,<a id="noteref_24" name="noteref_24" href="#note_24"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">24</span></span></a> and at Argos also the democracy rose at
the same period. At the time of Polybius, the people
had in the Doric states of Crete so unlimited an authority,
that this writer himself wonders that his description
of them should be so entirely opposed to all
former accounts.<a id="noteref_25" name="noteref_25" href="#note_25"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">25</span></span></a> But since, in general, these alterations
threw down the Doric families from their high
station, and put an end to the Doric customs, they
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page011">[pg 011]</span><a name="Pg011" id="Pg011" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
have not so strong a claim upon our attention, as the
peculiar system of the Doric form of government,
which was most strongly expressed in the ancient
Cretan and Lacedæmonian constitutions: the latter of
which, although in many points it yielded and adapted
itself to the progress of civilization, existed in its
essential parts for five centuries;<a id="noteref_26" name="noteref_26" href="#note_26"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">26</span></span></a> and by its durability
preserved Sparta alone among all the states of Greece from revolutions
and revolutionary excesses.<a id="noteref_27" name="noteref_27" href="#note_27"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">27</span></span></a>

<a name="Book_III_Chapter_I_Section_7" id="Book_III_Chapter_I_Section_7" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
7. But, it may be asked, what right have we to
speak of a Doric constitution in general; and why
should we select Sparta in preference to any other
state of the Doric race, as a model of that system?
May not Lycurgus have formed his legislation from
reflection upon the condition and wants of his own
nation, or have conceived it from arbitrary principles
of his own, and have thus impressed upon Sparta the
character which it ever after retained, as an essential
element of its system?<a id="noteref_28" name="noteref_28" href="#note_28"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">28</span></span></a> Against this opinion, not
unfrequently advanced, instead of bringing forward
any general arguments, we prefer adducing the words
of Pindar,<a id="noteref_29" name="noteref_29" href="#note_29"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">29</span></span></a> who, beyond a doubt, was far better acquainted
with the basis and origin of ancient constitutions,
than either Ephorus or Plutarch. Pindar mentions
that Hieron, the Syracusan, wished to establish
the new city of Ætna (which was inhabited by 5000
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page012">[pg 012]</span><a name="Pg012" id="Pg012" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Syracusans, and the same number of Peloponnesians)
upon the genuine Doric principles; as in later times
Dion wished to establish in Syracuse itself a Lacedæmonian
or Cretan constitution.<a id="noteref_30" name="noteref_30" href="#note_30"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">30</span></span></a> He founded it <span class="tei tei-q">“with
heaven-built freedom, according to the laws of the
Hylean model;”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, after the example of the
Spartan constitution. <span class="tei tei-q">“For the descendants of
Pamphylus, and of the Heraclidæ, who dwell under
the brow of Taygetus, wish always to retain the
Doric institutions of Ægimius.”</span> Now in the first
place, this passage proves that the laws of Sparta were
considered the true Doric institutions; and, secondly,
that their origin was held to be identical with that of
the people. It proves that the Spartan <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">laws</span></em> (νόμοι)
were the true Doric <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">institutions</span></em> (νόμιμα), and indeed,
in no other nation was the distinction between usage
and positive law less marked; from which circumstance
alone it is evident how little opportunity the
legislator had for fresh enactments, since custom can
never be the work of one person. From this view of
the subject we can also explain why Hellanicus, the
most ancient writer on the constitution of Sparta,<a id="noteref_31" name="noteref_31" href="#note_31"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">31</span></span></a>
made no mention of Lycurgus (for which he is ignorantly
censured by Ephorus),<a id="noteref_32" name="noteref_32" href="#note_32"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">32</span></span></a> and attributed what
are called the institutions of Lycurgus to the first
kings, Procles and Eurysthenes. It also follows, that
when Herodotus describes the Spartans before the
time of Lycurgus, as being in a state of the greatest
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page013">[pg 013]</span><a name="Pg013" id="Pg013" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
anarchy,<a id="noteref_33" name="noteref_33" href="#note_33"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">33</span></span></a> he can only mean that the original constitution
(the τεθμοὶ Αἰγιμίου) had been overthrown and
perverted by external circumstances, until it was restored
and renewed by Lycurgus. Lycurgus, of
whose real or imaginary existence we have already
spoken,<a id="noteref_34" name="noteref_34" href="#note_34"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">34</span></span></a> must at the time of Herodotus have
been considered a mythical personage, as he had a temple,
annual sacrifices, and, in fact, a regular worship.<a id="noteref_35" name="noteref_35" href="#note_35"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">35</span></span></a>
Now it is the tendency of mythological narration to
represent accordant actions of many minds at different
times under the name of one person: consequently, the
mere name of an institution of Lycurgus says very
little respecting its real origin and author.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
8. The legislation of Lycurgus was, however, according
to ancient traditions, aided by the support of
Crete and Delphi, and the connexion between the
religious usages of these states thus influenced their
political condition. The form of government which
was prevalent throughout the whole of Crete, originated,
according to the concurrent testimony of the
ancients, in the time of Minos; and it has been already
shown that the Dorians at that time extended their
dominion to this island, which thus received their
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page014">[pg 014]</span><a name="Pg014" id="Pg014" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
language and customs.<a id="noteref_36" name="noteref_36" href="#note_36"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">36</span></span></a> In Crete therefore, the constitution
founded on the principles of the Doric race,
was first moulded into a firm and consistent shape,
but even in a more simple and antiquated manner than
in Sparta at a subsequent period.<a id="noteref_37" name="noteref_37" href="#note_37"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">37</span></span></a> Thus Lycurgus
was enabled, without forcing any foreign usages upon
Sparta, to take for a model the Cretan institutions
which had been more fully developed at an earlier
period; so that the constitutions of Crete and Sparta
had from that time, as it were, a family resemblance.<a id="noteref_38" name="noteref_38" href="#note_38"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">38</span></span></a> When therefore we are told that a pæan singer and
expiatory priest of Crete, by name Thaletas of Elyrus,<a id="noteref_39" name="noteref_39" href="#note_39"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">39</span></span></a>
sent by the command of the Pythian oracle, composed
the troubles and dissensions of Sparta by the power of
his music, and that he was the instructor of Lycurgus;<a id="noteref_40" name="noteref_40" href="#note_40"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">40</span></span></a>
it is easy to perceive that the latter part of this account
is an addition, made without any attention to chronology;
but the operation of Cretan music upon the
regulation of political affairs, is strictly in the spirit of
an age, and of a race, in which religion, arts, and laws
conduced far more than among any other people to
attain the same end, and had their basis in the same
notions.

<a name="Book_III_Chapter_I_Section_9" id="Book_III_Chapter_I_Section_9" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
9. On the other hand, it was the pride of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page015">[pg 015]</span><a name="Pg015" id="Pg015" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Spartans, that their laws had proceeded from the oracle
of the Pythian god:<a id="noteref_41" name="noteref_41" href="#note_41"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">41</span></span></a> and Tyrtæus says, in some
verses of his Eunomia, that the fundamental principles
of the Spartan constitution had been laid down by
Apollo.<a id="noteref_42" name="noteref_42" href="#note_42"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">42</span></span></a> It is probable that these laws were really
composed in the form of injunctions to Lycurgus, or
to the people.<a id="noteref_43" name="noteref_43" href="#note_43"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">43</span></span></a> The oracle, however, continued to
possess a superintending power over the constitution,
chiefly through the intervention of the Pythians,<a id="noteref_44" name="noteref_44" href="#note_44"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">44</span></span></a> four
persons appointed by the kings as messengers to the
temple of Pytho, who delivered the oracles truly and
honestly to the kings,<a id="noteref_45" name="noteref_45" href="#note_45"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">45</span></span></a> and were equally acquainted
with their purport. On account of the importance of
these oracles, the Pythians were the assessors of the
kings and the gerusia,<a id="noteref_46" name="noteref_46" href="#note_46"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">46</span></span></a> and were always the messmates,
both at home and in the field, of the kings. It is
probable that the three <span class="tei tei-q">“Pythian interpreters”</span> at
Athens, who, besides explaining the oracles, performed
public and domestic expiatory sacrifices,<a id="noteref_47" name="noteref_47" href="#note_47"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">47</span></span></a> once possessed
a similar dignity, although they lost these
powers at a very early period. The theori of Ægina,
Mantinea, Messenia, Trœzen, and Thasos, who composed
separate colleges, ate together, and who were
regular magistrates, not being like the theori of Athens,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page016">[pg 016]</span><a name="Pg016" id="Pg016" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
chosen for a single theoria, may be compared with the
Pythians.<a id="noteref_48" name="noteref_48" href="#note_48"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">48</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<a name="Book_III_Chapter_I_Section_10" id="Book_III_Chapter_I_Section_10" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
10. This comparison again leads us back to our
former position, that in the genuine Doric form of
government there were certain predominant ideas,
which were peculiar to that race, and were also expressed
in the worship of Apollo, viz., those of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">harmony</span></em>
and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">order</span></em> (τὸ εὔκοσμον); of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">self-control and
moderation</span></em> (σωφροσύνη), and of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">manly virtue</span></em>
(ἀρετή).<a id="noteref_49" name="noteref_49" href="#note_49"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">49</span></span></a>
Accordingly, the constitution was formed for the education
as well of the old as of the young, and in a
Doric state education was upon the whole a subject
of greater importance than government. And for this
reason all attempts to explain the legislation of Lycurgus,
from partial views and considerations, have
necessarily failed. That external happiness and enjoyment
were not the aim of these institutions was
soon perceived. But it was thought, with Aristotle,<a id="noteref_50" name="noteref_50" href="#note_50"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">50</span></span></a>
that every thing could be traced to a desire of making
the Spartans courageous warriors, and Sparta a dominant
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page017">[pg 017]</span><a name="Pg017" id="Pg017" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and conquering state; whereas the fact is, that
Sparta was hardly ever known to seek occasion for a
war, or to follow up a victory; and during the whole
of her flourishing period (that is, from about the 50th
Olympiad to the battle of Leuctra) did not make a
single conquest by which her territory was enlarged.
In conclusion we may say, that the Doric state was
a body of men, acknowledging one strict principle of
order, and one unalterable rule of manners; and so
subjecting themselves to this system, that scarcely anything
was unfettered by it, but every action was influenced
and regulated by the recognised principles.
Before however we come to the consideration of this
system, it will be necessary to explain the condition of
an order of persons, upon which it was in a certain
measure founded, namely, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">subject classes</span></em> in the
several Doric states.

1. The clearest notion of the subjection enforced
by the dominant race of Dorians may be collected
from the speech of Brasidas to the Peloponnesians,
in Thucydides.<a id="noteref_51" name="noteref_51" href="#note_51"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">51</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“You are not come,”</span> he says,

had by the sword driven out the Achæans, and these
again could not rest their claim to Peloponnesus on
any better title. It seemed also like a continuation of
the heroic age, the existence of which was founded on
the rule exercised by the military over the agricultural
classes. The relative rights of the Dorians
and Achæans appear, however, to have been determined
by mutual compact, since the Dorians, obtaining
the superiority only by slow degrees, were
doubtless glad to purchase the accession of each town
on moderate conditions; and this was perhaps especially
the case in Messenia.<a id="noteref_52" name="noteref_52" href="#note_52"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">52</span></span></a> The native inhabitants
of the towns, thus reduced to a state of dependence,
were called Περίοικοι.<a id="noteref_53" name="noteref_53" href="#note_53"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">53</span></span></a> The difference of races was
strictly preserved; and was not (as elsewhere) obliterated
by an union in the same city and political
community. The Periœci were always considered as
Achæans, that people having in early times composed
the larger mass of the people thus subdued. So, for
example, the inhabitants of the maritime town of
Asopus were called by the title of Ἀχαιοὶ οἱ
παρακοπαρίσσιοι.<a id="noteref_54" name="noteref_54" href="#note_54"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">54</span></span></a>
At a later date, when the power of
Sparta had been long broken, and her freedom annihilated
by the tyrant Nabis, Titus Quinctius detached
the hamlets (once called πόλεις, then κῶμαι,
<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">vici</span></span>) from all connexion with Sparta, and placed
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page019">[pg 019]</span><a name="Pg019" id="Pg019" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
them under the protection of the Achæan league.<a id="noteref_55" name="noteref_55" href="#note_55"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">55</span></span></a>
Augustus confirmed the independence of twenty-four
Laconian towns under the name of Eleutherolacones;
these, like the former, being entirely released
from the power of Sparta, were governed by
their own laws,<a id="noteref_56" name="noteref_56" href="#note_56"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">56</span></span></a> and formed
a small distinct confederation.
Hence it is evident that these Periœci had
previously maintained a certain degree of independence,
and composed separate communities. Of these
twenty-four towns eighteen are mentioned—viz., Gerenia,
Alagonia, Thalamæ, Leuctra, Œtylus, Cænepolis,
Pyrrhichus, Las, Teuthrone, Gythium, Asopus,
Acriæ, Bœæ, Zarax, Epidaurus, Limera, Prasiæ,
Geronthræ, and Marius;<a id="noteref_57" name="noteref_57" href="#note_57"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">57</span></span></a> a small part only of the
coast near Cardamyle remained at that time under the
power of Sparta.<a id="noteref_58" name="noteref_58" href="#note_58"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">58</span></span></a> The towns, however, belonging
to the Periœci did not lie merely on the coast, but
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page020">[pg 020]</span><a name="Pg020" id="Pg020" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
also more inland; for example, Thuria and Æthæa,
which were in what had formerly been Messenia.<a id="noteref_59" name="noteref_59" href="#note_59"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">59</span></span></a>
This Æthæa is reckoned among the hundred cities
of Laconia,<a id="noteref_60" name="noteref_60" href="#note_60"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">60</span></span></a> which Androtion had enumerated at
full length in his Atthis, and perhaps also Stephanus
of Byzantium, on the authority of Androtion;<a id="noteref_61" name="noteref_61" href="#note_61"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">61</span></span></a> the
epitome of whose work which we now possess only
mentions Æthæa, Amyclæ, Croceæ, Epidaurus, Limera,
Dyrrachium, Tenos, Aulon, and Anthana.
Now since two of these towns are known from other
authorities to have belonged to Periœci, we may perhaps
infer the same of the whole hundred. The round
number of a hundred cannot however have been fixed
before the time when the whole of Messenia, as far as
the river Neda (on which Aulon was situated), as
well as Cynuria (to which Anthana, or Athene,
belonged), came finally under the dominion of Sparta,
that is to say, after Olymp. 58. 548 B.C.<a id="noteref_62" name="noteref_62" href="#note_62"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">62</span></span></a> It must
therefore have been subsequent to this epoch that
Sparta fixed the exact number of the towns inhabited
by her Periœci, and somewhat arbitrarily set
them at a hundred; as Cleisthenes at Athens, though
by what means is indeed unknown, contrived likewise
to raise the number of demi in Attica to a hundred.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We have already<a id="noteref_63" name="noteref_63" href="#note_63"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">63</span></span></a> taken
notice of another division
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page021">[pg 021]</span><a name="Pg021" id="Pg021" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of Laconia besides that into towns, and shown that the
Periœci of this country had formerly dwelt in five
districts, of which the chief towns were Amyclæ, Las,
Epidaurus Limera (or else Gytheium), Ægys, and
Pharis; as also Messenia, in addition to the territory
round the city inhabited by Dorians, contained four
provinces—viz., Pylos, Rhium, Mesola, and Hyamia.
For what length of time these districts were retained,
and what relation they bore to the division into a
hundred towns or hamlets, cannot now be determined.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. It will next be necessary to ascertain what were
the political rights and condition of the Periœci. The
main circumstances are without doubt correctly given
by Ephorus. <span class="tei tei-q">“They were,”</span> he says, <span class="tei tei-q">“tributary to
Sparta, and had not equal rights of citizenship.”</span>
If these words are taken in their literal sense, it is
plain that the Periœci had not a share in the great
legislative assembly of the citizens. And in truth
the passages adduced by modern writers to show that
they had a vote in this assembly are not by any means
satisfactory.<a id="noteref_64" name="noteref_64" href="#note_64"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">64</span></span></a> Perhaps the following considerations
are sufficient to convince us of the impossibility of
such general assemblies. Had the Spartan constitution
permitted the whole people to hold large assemblies
with the right of deciding on all public questions,
it would have been in principle completely democratic,
and would have had a perpetual tendency to become
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page022">[pg 022]</span><a name="Pg022" id="Pg022" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
more so, in the necessary course of events. But, in
addition to this objection, let us only picture to ourselves
the absurdity of the Periœci, in the neighbourhood
of Sparta, all flocking together between the
brook Babyca and the bridge Cnacion! Where
again were those, who took several days to arrive at
Sparta from Cyphanta, Pylos, or Tænarus, to find
houseroom and food? How could any of them be
ready to leave their homes and trades at such a summons?
It was esteemed a difficult matter even to
collect an armed force of Periœci at a short notice.
A <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">city-community</span></em> was doubtless everywhere requisite
for a popular assembly; and hence in the Athenian,
and every similar democracy, each citizen was in
some way settled in the town, and had the right of
there possessing an house (ἔγκτησις οἰκίας), which a
Periœcus most assuredly had not.<a id="noteref_65" name="noteref_65" href="#note_65"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">65</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<a name="Book_III_Chapter_II_Section_3" id="Book_III_Chapter_II_Section_3" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
3. Now, if it is acknowledged that the distant
situation and state of the Periœci presented almost
insuperable objections to their possessing a share in
the general government, their political inferiority to
the Spartans will not appear very oppressive. They
were admitted equally with the Spartans to the honourable
occupation of war, and indeed sometimes
served as heavy-armed soldiers, or as troops of the
line.<a id="noteref_66" name="noteref_66" href="#note_66"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">66</span></span></a> There were at Platæa 5000 Dorian hoplitæ,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page023">[pg 023]</span><a name="Pg023" id="Pg023" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and the same number of Periœci; at Sphacteria 292
prisoners were taken, of whom only 120 were Spartans.<a id="noteref_67" name="noteref_67" href="#note_67"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">67</span></span></a>
How, if the Periœci had been an oppressed
people, could Sparta have ventured to collect so
large a number into her armies; and for what reason
should the Periœci have taken part in the heroic
devotion of that small band, if they had not the
victory and honour of Sparta as much at heart as
their own? <span class="tei tei-q">“Sparta,”</span> said the Spartan king Demaratus,
to Xerxes,<a id="noteref_68" name="noteref_68" href="#note_68"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">68</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“contains 8000 Spartans, all of
equal bravery; the other Lacedæmonians, in many
surrounding cities, are indeed inferior to them, but
yet not deficient in courage.”</span> Nor do we hear of
any insurrection of Periœci (if we except the revolt
of two Messenian towns in Olymp. 78. 468 B.C.)
until the downfall of the constitution.<a id="noteref_69" name="noteref_69" href="#note_69"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">69</span></span></a> Again, would
it be possible, on the assumption of an oppressive
subjection, to explain how the Asinæans and Nauplians,
when deprived of their independence by Argos,
fled to Laconia, that they might occupy the maritime
towns of Mothone and Asine, manifestly as Periœci?
Nor is it consistent with a general contempt of the
Periœci that καλοὶ καγαθοὶ—<span class="tei tei-q">“gentlemen”</span>—are mentioned
in their number.<a id="noteref_70" name="noteref_70" href="#note_70"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">70</span></span></a> All trade and commerce,
of indispensable need to Laconia, were in the hands
of the maritime towns. Merchants from Libya and
Egypt brought their cargoes to the Periœci of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page024">[pg 024]</span><a name="Pg024" id="Pg024" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Cythera,<a id="noteref_71" name="noteref_71" href="#note_71"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">71</span></span></a>
who, among other branches of trade, followed
the lucrative employment of the purple fishery.<a id="noteref_72" name="noteref_72" href="#note_72"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">72</span></span></a> All
manual labour in Sparta, not performed by slaves,
was in the hands of this class, since no Spartan,
before the introduction of the Achæan constitution,
was allowed to follow any trade.<a id="noteref_73" name="noteref_73" href="#note_73"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">73</span></span></a> The low estimation
in which trade was held was founded on the ancient
Grecian customs and opinions, in departing from
which the Corinthians were nearly singular among
the Doric states, the productiveness of trade having
taught them to set a higher value upon it.<a id="noteref_74" name="noteref_74" href="#note_74"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">74</span></span></a> And
yet in their colony of Epidamnus public slaves were
the only manual labourers;<a id="noteref_75" name="noteref_75" href="#note_75"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">75</span></span></a> Diophantus
wished to introduce the converse of this system at Athens, and
to make all the manual labourers slaves. The Spartans,
moreover, appear to have admitted those alone
of the Periœci who were engaged in agriculture to
serve among the heavy-armed, while artisans were
admitted only to the light-armed infantry.<a id="noteref_76" name="noteref_76" href="#note_76"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">76</span></span></a> This
had been once the case at Athens, where the Thetes
(to which class the artificers belonged) served only
in that inferior rank. According to this, then, the
5000 Periœci, who at the battle of Platæa were
allotted as light-armed to the same number of heavy-armed
soldiers, were in part perhaps artificers. The
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page025">[pg 025]</span><a name="Pg025" id="Pg025" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
industrious pursuit of trade did not, however, suffer so
much as might be supposed, from the low estimation
in which it was held; for not only were many raw
commodities obtained in a high degree of perfection
in Laconia, but many Lacedæmonian manufactures
were also used and sought after in the rest of Greece.

woollen garments dyed with native purple, which
adorned alike the warriors setting out to battle and
the bloody corpses of the slain; all these bespeak an
active pursuit of trade, and at the same time a peculiar
sense of propriety and comfort, which brought several
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page026">[pg 026]</span><a name="Pg026" id="Pg026" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of these goods and implements into general use.
Many men were probably employed in the iron mines
and forges;<a id="noteref_88" name="noteref_88" href="#note_88"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">88</span></span></a> stone quarries of Tænarus had also been

was not confined to the mere drudgery of manufactures
is shown by the schools of Lacedæmonian embossers
and brass-founders (probably a branch of that
in Crete), to which Chartas, Syadras, Dontas, Dorycleidas
and Medon, Theocles, Gitiadas, and Cratinus
belonged,<a id="noteref_90" name="noteref_90" href="#note_90"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">90</span></span></a> all of whom were probably Periœci, although
Pausanias, neglecting the distinction, calls
them Spartans. Upon the whole we may venture to
affirm that the Doric dominion did not discourage or
stifle the intellectual growth of her dependent subjects,
but allowed it full room for a vigorous development.
Myson, by many reckoned one of the
seven sages, was, according to some, and perhaps the
most credible accounts, a husbandman of the Laconian
town of Etia, and resided at a place called Chen in the
same country.<a id="noteref_91" name="noteref_91" href="#note_91"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">91</span></span></a> Even the highest honour among the

Greeks, the victory at the Olympic games, was not
denied to the Lacedæmonians; an inhabitant of
Acriæ was found in the list of the conquerors at
Olympia:<a id="noteref_92" name="noteref_92" href="#note_92"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">92</span></span></a> from which circumstance it is evident
that the Periœci of Sparta were in all other parts
of Greece considered as free citizens. They must
also without doubt have possessed civil rights, but
only in those communities to which they immediately
belonged, and which would never have been called
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cities</span></em> (πόλεις) unless they had to a certain point been
independent bodies. Isocrates,<a id="noteref_93" name="noteref_93" href="#note_93"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">93</span></span></a> indeed, states that
they possessed less freedom and power than the demi
of Attica; but no general comparison can be drawn
between the δῆμοι of Attica and πόλεις of Laconia.
Perhaps they had the power of electing their own
municipal magistrates, though we find that a Spartan
was sent as governor to the island of Cythera.<a id="noteref_94" name="noteref_94" href="#note_94"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">94</span></span></a> The
same was the case in war. We find the command
at sea intrusted to one of the class of Periœci,<a id="noteref_95" name="noteref_95" href="#note_95"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">95</span></span></a> doubtless
because the Spartans did not hold the naval service
in much estimation, and because the inhabitants of the
maritime towns were more practised in naval affairs
than the Dorians of the interior. Concerning the
tribute of the towns belonging to the Periœci no accurate
account has been preserved.

4. Though for the most part the early inhabitants
were driven into the country by the Doric conquerors,
there still remained some families which inhabited the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page028">[pg 028]</span><a name="Pg028" id="Pg028" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
city conjointly with the Spartans, and were held in
equal consideration with them; as at Athens, for example,
many families of the original inhabitants appear
to have had the rank of Eupatridæ. Of this the Talthybiadæ
are an instance. The office of herald was at
Sparta (as in the fabulous times) hereditary, and not,
as in other parts of Greece, obtained by competition.<a id="noteref_96" name="noteref_96" href="#note_96"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">96</span></span></a>

and a share in the sacred missions,<a id="noteref_98" name="noteref_98" href="#note_98"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">98</span></span></a> were
assigned to the pretended descendants of the Mycenean
herald Talthybius, who also enjoyed especial honours
amongst the Achæans at Ægium;<a id="noteref_99" name="noteref_99" href="#note_99"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">99</span></span></a> and there is doubtless
reason to suppose that this family belonged to the
Achæan race, without entering into the question of the
correctness of their pedigree. The dignity attached to
their office was very great, especially if, as was the
case in the heroic ages, it was the custom for the
heralds to address the princes as <span class="tei tei-q">“beloved sons.”</span> As
to property and effects, they ranked with the first
Spartans,<a id="noteref_100" name="noteref_100" href="#note_100"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">100</span></span></a> if, as it appears, Sperthias and
Bulis, who offered themselves to the Persian king as an atonement
for the murder of his ambassadors,<a id="noteref_101" name="noteref_101" href="#note_101"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">101</span></span></a> were of the
family of the Talthybiadæ.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Indeed almost all the other trades and occupations,
besides that of herald, were hereditary at Sparta, as,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page029">[pg 029]</span><a name="Pg029" id="Pg029" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
for example, those of cooking, baking, mixing wine,
flute-playing, &amp;c.<a id="noteref_102" name="noteref_102" href="#note_102"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">102</span></span></a> The trade of cooks had its particular
heroes, viz., Dæton, Matton, and Ceraon, whose
statue stood in the Hyacinthian street.<a id="noteref_103" name="noteref_103" href="#note_103"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">103</span></span></a> It is easy to
see how this hereditary transmission of employments
favoured the maintenance of ancient customs. In fact,
Sparta would not have so long remained contented
with her black broth, either if her cooks had not learnt
the art of dressing it from their youth upwards, and
continued to exercise their craft after the manner of
their fathers, or if this office could have been assigned
at will to those who were able by their art to gratify
the palate. It is not probable that any of these families
of artisans were of Doric origin, and they doubtless
belonged to the class of Periœci; nor is it to be
supposed that, like the Talthybiadæ, they possessed
the Spartan rights of citizenship.<a id="noteref_104" name="noteref_104" href="#note_104"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">104</span></span></a>

1. The condition of the Periœci and that of the
Helots must be carefully distinguished from each other;
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page030">[pg 030]</span><a name="Pg030" id="Pg030" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the latter state may be termed <span class="tei tei-q">“villenage,”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“bondage,”</span>
to which that of the Periœci had not the slightest
resemblance.<a id="noteref_105" name="noteref_105" href="#note_105"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">105</span></span></a> The common account of the origin
of this class is, that the inhabitants of the maritime
town Helos were reduced by Sparta to this state of
degradation, after an insurrection against the Dorians
already established in power.<a id="noteref_106" name="noteref_106" href="#note_106"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">106</span></span></a> This explanation,
however, rests merely on an etymology, and that by no
means a probable one; since such a Gentile name as
Εἵλως (which seems to be the more ancient form)
cannot by any method of formation have been derived
from Ἕλος. The word Εἵλως is probably a derivative
from Ἕλω; in a passive sense, and consequently means
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the prisoners</span></em>.<a id="noteref_107" name="noteref_107" href="#note_107"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">107</span></span></a> Perhaps it signifies those who were
taken after having resisted to the uttermost, whereas
the Periœci had surrendered upon conditions; at least
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page031">[pg 031]</span><a name="Pg031" id="Pg031" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Theopompus<a id="noteref_108" name="noteref_108" href="#note_108"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">108</span></span></a> calls them Achæans as well as
the others. It appears, however, more probable that they were an
aboriginal race, which was subdued at a very early
period, and which immediately passed over as slaves to
the Doric conquerors.<a id="noteref_109" name="noteref_109" href="#note_109"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">109</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In speaking of the condition of the Helots, we will
consider their political rights and their personal treatment
under separate heads, though in fact the two
subjects are very nearly connected. The first were
doubtless exactly defined by law and custom, though
the expressions made use of by ancient authors are
frequently vague and ambiguous. <span class="tei tei-q">“They were,”</span> says
Ephorus,<a id="noteref_110" name="noteref_110" href="#note_110"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">110</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“in a certain point of view public slaves.
Their possessor could neither liberate them, nor sell
them beyond the borders.”</span> From this it is evident
that they were considered as belonging properly to the
state, which to a certain degree permitted them to be
possessed, and apportioned them out to individuals, reserving
to itself the power of enfranchising them. But
to sell them out of the country was not in the power
even of the state; and, to the best of our knowledge,
such an event never occurred. It is, upon the whole,
most probable that individuals had no power to sell
them at all; since they were, for the most part,
attached to the land, which was inalienable. On these
lands they had certain fixed dwellings of their own,
and particular services and payments were prescribed
to them.<a id="noteref_111" name="noteref_111" href="#note_111"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">111</span></span></a> They paid as rent a fixed measure of corn;
not, however, like the Periœci, to the state, but to their
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page032">[pg 032]</span><a name="Pg032" id="Pg032" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
masters. As this quantity had been definitively settled
at a very early period (to raise the amount being forbidden
under heavy imprecations),<a id="noteref_112" name="noteref_112" href="#note_112"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">112</span></span></a> the Helots were
the persons who profited by a good, and lost by a bad
harvest; which must have been to them an encouragement
to industry and good husbandry; a motive which
would have been wanting, if the profit and loss had
merely affected the landlords. And thus (as is proved
by the accounts respecting the Spartan agriculture),<a id="noteref_113" name="noteref_113" href="#note_113"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">113</span></span></a>
a careful management of the cultivation of the soil was
kept up. By means of the rich produce of the land,
and in part by plunder obtained in war,<a id="noteref_114" name="noteref_114" href="#note_114"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">114</span></span></a> they
collected a considerable property,<a id="noteref_115" name="noteref_115" href="#note_115"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">115</span></span></a> to the attainment of which
almost every access was closed to the Spartans. Now
the annual rent paid for each lot was eighty-two medimni
of barley, and a proportionate quantity of oil
and wine.<a id="noteref_116" name="noteref_116" href="#note_116"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">116</span></span></a> It may therefore be asked how much
remained to the Helots themselves, after paying this
amount of corn from each lot. Tyrtæus appears to
give some information, where he describes the Messenian
bondmen<a id="noteref_117" name="noteref_117" href="#note_117"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">117</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“as groaning like asses under heavy
burdens, and compelled by force to pay to their masters
a half of the entire produce of the land.”</span><a id="noteref_118" name="noteref_118" href="#note_118"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">118</span></span></a>
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page033">[pg 033]</span><a name="Pg033" id="Pg033" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
According to this account, the families of the Helots
(of which many resided on one lot) would have retained
only eighty-two medimni on an average, and the whole
amount would have been one hundred and sixty-four.
But this cannot be the institution of which Plutarch
speaks; and Tyrtæus doubtless describes some oppression
much aggravated by particular circumstances.
For, assuming that the property of the Spartans
amounted to two-thirds of the whole Laconian territory,
which may be rated at three thousand eight hundred
and forty square miles English, and three-fourths
being deducted for hill, wood, pasture-land, vineyards,
and plantations, we have two thousand eight hundred
and eighty square miles for the nine thousand lots of
the Spartans; each of which accordingly amounted
to 72/225 of a square mile, or one hundred and ninety-two
plethra; a space amply sufficient to have produced
four hundred medimni,<a id="noteref_119" name="noteref_119" href="#note_119"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">119</span></span></a> which, after the deduction of
the eighty-two medimni, would have supplied twenty-one
men with double the common daily allowance, viz.,
one chœnix of bread. It is at least manifest that each
lot would have been quite sufficient to maintain six or
seven families of Helots. It must not, however, be
supposed that the rent was precisely the same for all
the lots of the Spartan territory. The different quality
of the land made such a strict equalization impossible;
not to mention that it would have entirely
destroyed all interest in the possession. We even
know that many Spartans were possessed of herds and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page034">[pg 034]</span><a name="Pg034" id="Pg034" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
flocks, from which they provided young animals for
the public meals.<a id="noteref_120" name="noteref_120" href="#note_120"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">120</span></span></a> The proprietors, besides their share
of the harvest, received from their lands, at particular
periods, the fruits of the season.<a id="noteref_121" name="noteref_121" href="#note_121"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">121</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There could not, on the whole, have been much
intercourse and connexion between the Spartans, as
possessors of the land, and the bondsmen upon their
estates. For how little interest would the Spartan,
who seldom left the town, and then only for a few
days,<a id="noteref_122" name="noteref_122" href="#note_122"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">122</span></span></a> have felt for Helots, who dwelt perhaps at Mothone!
Nevertheless, the cultivation of the land was
not the only duty of the Helots; they also attended
upon their masters at the public meal,<a id="noteref_123" name="noteref_123" href="#note_123"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">123</span></span></a> who, according
to the Lacedæmonian principle of a community of
goods, mutually lent them to one another.<a id="noteref_124" name="noteref_124" href="#note_124"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">124</span></span></a> A large
number of them was also doubtless employed by the
state in public works.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<a name="Book_III_Chapter_III_Section_2" id="Book_III_Chapter_III_Section_2" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
2. In the field the Helots never served as Hoplitæ,
except in extraordinary cases; and then it was the
general practice afterwards to give them their liberty.<a id="noteref_125" name="noteref_125" href="#note_125"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">125</span></span></a>
On other occasions they attended the regular army as
light-armed troops; and that their numbers were very
considerable may be seen from the battle of Platæa, in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page035">[pg 035]</span><a name="Pg035" id="Pg035" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
which 5000 Spartans were attended by 35,000 Helots.<a id="noteref_126" name="noteref_126" href="#note_126"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">126</span></span></a>
Although they did not share the honour of the
heavy-armed soldiers, they were in return exposed to
a less degree of danger. For while the former in
close rank received the onset of the enemy with spear
and shield, the Helots, armed only with the sling and
light javelin, were in a moment either before or behind
the ranks, as Tyrtæus accurately describes the
relative duties of the light-armed soldier (γύμνης), and
the Hoplite. Sparta, in her better time, is never recorded
to have unnecessarily sacrificed the lives of her
Helots. A certain number of them was allotted to
each Spartan;<a id="noteref_127" name="noteref_127" href="#note_127"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">127</span></span></a> at the battle of Platæa this number
was seven. Those who were assigned to a single
master were probably called ἀμπίτταρες.<a id="noteref_128" name="noteref_128" href="#note_128"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">128</span></span></a> Of these,
however, one in particular was the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">servant</span></em> (θεράπων)
of his master, as in the story of the blind Spartan,
who was conducted by his Helot into the thickest of
the battle of Thermopylæ, and, while the latter fled,
fell with the other heroes.<a id="noteref_129" name="noteref_129" href="#note_129"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">129</span></span></a> Θεράπων, or servant, is
the appropriate, and indeed honourable, appellation
which the Dorians, particularly in Crete, gave to the
armed slaves;<a id="noteref_130" name="noteref_130" href="#note_130"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">130</span></span></a> these in Sparta were probably called
ἐρυκτῆρες, in allusion to their duty of drawing (ἐρύκειν)
the wounded from the ranks.<a id="noteref_131" name="noteref_131" href="#note_131"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">131</span></span></a> It appears that the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page036">[pg 036]</span><a name="Pg036" id="Pg036" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Helots were in the field placed more immediately
under the command of the king than the rest of the
army.<a id="noteref_132" name="noteref_132" href="#note_132"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">132</span></span></a> In the fleet, they composed the
large mass of the sailors,<a id="noteref_133" name="noteref_133" href="#note_133"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">133</span></span></a> in which
service at Athens the inferior
citizens and slaves were employed; when serving in
this manner they were, it appears, called by the name
of δεσποσιοναῦται.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These accounts are sufficient to give a tolerably
correct notion of the relation of the Helots to the
Doric citizens of Sparta. Although it does not fall
within the scope of the present work to enter upon a
moral or political examination of the condition of Helotism,
I may be allowed to subjoin a few observations.
The Grecian states then either contained a class of
bondsmen, which can be traced in nearly all the Doric
states, or they had slaves, who had been brought either
by plunder or commerce from barbarous countries;
or a class of slaves was altogether wanting. The last
was the case among the Phoceans, Locrians, and other
Greeks.<a id="noteref_134" name="noteref_134" href="#note_134"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">134</span></span></a> But these nations, through the scantiness
of their resources, never attained to such power as
Sparta and Athens. Slavery was the basis of the
prosperity of all commercial states, and was intimately
connected with foreign trade; but (besides being a
continued violation of justice) it was upon the whole
of little advantage to the public, especially in time of
war; and, according to the doctrine of the ancient
politicians, it was both fraught with danger, and prejudicial
to morality and good order. It must also be
remembered, that nearly all the ties of family were
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page037">[pg 037]</span><a name="Pg037" id="Pg037" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
broken among the slaves of Athens, with which the
institution of bondage did not at all interfere;<a id="noteref_135" name="noteref_135" href="#note_135"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">135</span></span></a> and
that in the latter the condition of the bondmen was
rather determined by general custom; in the former,
by the arbitrary will of individuals. Sparta had, indeed,
some foreign slaves, but their number was very
inconsiderable. Thus Alcman, the slave of Agesidas,<a id="noteref_136" name="noteref_136" href="#note_136"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">136</span></span></a> was the son of a slave from Sardis,<a id="noteref_137" name="noteref_137" href="#note_137"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">137</span></span></a> who had perhaps
been brought by Cretan traders to the coast of Laconia.

3. It is a matter of much greater difficulty to form
a clear notion of the treatment of the Helots, and of
their manner of life; for the rhetorical spirit with
which later historians have embellished their philanthropic
views, joined to our own ignorance, has been
productive of much confusion and misconception.
Myron of Priene, in his romance on the Messenian
war, drew a very dark picture of Sparta, and endeavoured
at the end to rouse the feelings of his readers
by a description of the fate which the conquered underwent.
<span class="tei tei-q">“The Helots,”</span> says he,<a id="noteref_138" name="noteref_138" href="#note_138"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">138</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“perform for the
Spartans every ignominious service. They are compelled
to wear a cap of dog's skin and a covering of
sheep's skin, and they are severely beaten every year
without having committed any fault, in order that
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page038">[pg 038]</span><a name="Pg038" id="Pg038" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
they may never forget that they are slaves. In addition
to this, those amongst them who, either by
their stature or their beauty, raise themselves above
the condition of a slave, are condemned to death;
and the masters who do not destroy the most manly
of them are liable to punishment.”</span> The partiality
and ignorance of this writer is evident from his very
first statement. The Helots wore the leathern cap
with a broad band, and the covering of sheep's skin,
simply because it was the original dress of the natives;
which moreover the Arcadians had retained from ancient
usage;<a id="noteref_139" name="noteref_139" href="#note_139"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">139</span></span></a> Laertes the father of Ulysses, when he
assumed the character of a peasant, is also represented
as wearing a cap of goat's skin.<a id="noteref_140" name="noteref_140" href="#note_140"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">140</span></span></a> The truth is,
that the ancients made a distinction between town and
country costume. Hence, when the tyrants of Sicyon
wished to accustom the unemployed people, whose
numbers they dreaded, to a country life, they forced
them to wear the κατωνάκη, which had underneath a
lining of fur.<a id="noteref_141" name="noteref_141" href="#note_141"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">141</span></span></a> The Pisistratidæ made use of the
very same measure.<a id="noteref_142" name="noteref_142" href="#note_142"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">142</span></span></a> Thus also Theognis describes
the countrymen of Megara (whose admission to the
rights of citizenship he deplores) as clothed with
dressed skins, and dwelling around the town like
frightened deer.<a id="noteref_143" name="noteref_143" href="#note_143"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">143</span></span></a> The
<span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">dipthera</span></span> of the Helots therefore
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page039">[pg 039]</span><a name="Pg039" id="Pg039" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
signified nothing more humiliating and degrading
than their employment in agricultural labour. Myron
is doubtless right in stating that the Helots could not
lay aside this dress at pleasure; indeed, a young Spartan
could not assume the dress of an older man.
Whilst in Athens the influence of democracy had produced
an uniformity of dress, and even (according to
Xenophon)<a id="noteref_144" name="noteref_144" href="#note_144"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">144</span></span></a> of bodily form, in citizens,
resident aliens, and slaves; in Sparta the several orders were characterised
by external differences. Now since Myron
thus manifestly misinterpreted this circumstance, it is
very probable that his other objections are founded in
error; nor can misrepresentations of this political
state, which was unknown to the later Greeks, and
particularly to the class of writers, have been uncommon.
Plutarch,<a id="noteref_145" name="noteref_145" href="#note_145"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">145</span></span></a> for example, relates that
the Helots were compelled to intoxicate themselves, and perform
indecent dances, as a warning to the Spartan youth;
but common sense is opposed to so absurd a method
of education. Is it possible that the Spartans should
have so degraded the men whom they appointed as
tutors over their young children? Female Helots
also discharged the office of nurse in the royal palaces,<a id="noteref_146" name="noteref_146" href="#note_146"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">146</span></span></a> and doubtless obtained all the affection with which the
attendants of early youth were honoured in ancient
times. It is, however, certain that the Doric laws did
not bind servants to strict temperance;<a id="noteref_147" name="noteref_147" href="#note_147"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">147</span></span></a> and hence
examples of drunkenness among them might have
served as a means of recommending sobriety. It was
also an established regulation, that the national songs
and dances of Sparta were forbidden to the
Helots,<a id="noteref_148" name="noteref_148" href="#note_148"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">148</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page040">[pg 040]</span><a name="Pg040" id="Pg040" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
who, on the other hand, had some extravagant and
lascivious dances peculiar to themselves, which may
have given rise to the above report.<a id="noteref_149" name="noteref_149" href="#note_149"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">149</span></span></a> We must, moreover,
bear in mind, that most of the strangers who
visited Sparta, and gave an account of its institutions,
seized upon particular cases which they had imperfectly
observed, and, without knowing their real nature,
described them in the light suggested by their
own false prepossessions.

4. But are we not labouring in vain to soften the
bad impression of Myron's account, since the fearful
word <span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">crypteia</span></span> is of itself sufficient to show
the unhappy fate of the Helots, and the cruelty of their
masters? By this word is generally understood, a
chase of the Helots, annually undertaken at a fixed
time by the youth of Sparta, who either assassinated
them by night, or massacred them formally in open
day, in order to lessen their numbers, and weaken their
power.<a id="noteref_150" name="noteref_150" href="#note_150"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">150</span></span></a> Isocrates speaks of this institution in a very

to Lycurgus, and represent it as a war which the
Ephors themselves, on entering upon their yearly
office, proclaimed against the Helots. Thus it was a
regularly legalised massacre, and the more barbarous,
as its periodical arrival could be foreseen by the unhappy
victims. And yet were not these Helots, who
in many districts lived entirely alone, united by despair
for the sake of common protection, and did they not
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page041">[pg 041]</span><a name="Pg041" id="Pg041" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
every year kindle a most bloody and determined war
throughout the whole of Laconia? Such are the inextricable
difficulties in which we are involved by giving
credit to the received accounts: the solution of
which is, in my opinion, to be found in the speech of
Megillus the Spartan, in the Laws of Plato,<a id="noteref_153" name="noteref_153" href="#note_153"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">153</span></span></a> who is

says, <span class="tei tei-q">“what is called the <span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">crypteia</span></span>, the pain
of undergoing which is scarcely credible. It consists in
going barefoot in storms, in enduring the privations
of the camp, performing menial offices without a
servant, and wandering night and day through the
whole country.”</span> The same is more clearly expressed
in another passage,<a id="noteref_154" name="noteref_154" href="#note_154"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">154</span></span></a> where the philosopher
settles, that in his state sixty agronomi or phylarchs,
should each choose twelve young men from the age of
twenty-five to thirty, and send them as guards in succession
through the several districts, in order to inspect
the fortresses, roads, and public buildings in the
country; for which purpose they should have power
to make free use of the slaves. During this time they
were to live sparingly, to minister to their own wants,
and range through the whole country in arms without
intermission, both in winter and summer. These
persons were to be called κρυπτοὶ, or ἀγορανόμοι.
Can it be supposed that Plato would have here used
the name of <span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">crypteia</span></span>,
if it signified an assassination of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page042">[pg 042]</span><a name="Pg042" id="Pg042" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the Helots, or rather, if there was not an exact agreement
in essentials between the institution which he
proposed, and that in existence at Sparta, although
the latter was perhaps one of greater hardship and
severity? The youth of Sparta were also sent out,
under certain officers,<a id="noteref_155" name="noteref_155" href="#note_155"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">155</span></span></a> partly for the purpose of training
them to hardships, partly of inspecting the territory
of Sparta, which was of considerable extent. These
emissaries may probably have kept a strict watch upon
the Helots, who, living by themselves, and entirely
separated from their masters, must have been for that
reason the more formidable to Sparta. We must allow
that oppression and severity were not sufficiently
provided against; only the aim of the custom was
wholly different; though perhaps it is reckoned by
Thucydides<a id="noteref_156" name="noteref_156" href="#note_156"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">156</span></span></a> among those institutions which, as he
says, were established for the purpose of keeping a
watch over the Helots.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is hardly necessary to remark that this established
institution of the crypteia was in no way connected
with those extraordinary measures to which Sparta
thought herself compelled in hazardous circumstances
to resort. Thucydides leaves us to guess the fate of
the 2000 Helots who, after having been destined for
the field, suddenly disappeared. It was the curse of
this bondage (of which Plato says that it produced the
greatest doubt and difficulty)<a id="noteref_157" name="noteref_157" href="#note_157"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">157</span></span></a> that the slaves abandoned
their masters when they stood in greatest need
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page043">[pg 043]</span><a name="Pg043" id="Pg043" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of their assistance; and hence the Spartans were even
compelled to stipulate in treaties for aid against their
own subjects.<a id="noteref_158" name="noteref_158" href="#note_158"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">158</span></span></a>

5. A more favourable side of the Spartan system
of bondage is, that a legal way to liberty and citizenship
stood open to the Helots.<a id="noteref_159" name="noteref_159" href="#note_159"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">159</span></span></a> The many intermediate
steps seem to prove the existence of a regular
mode of transition from the one rank to the other.
The Helots, who were esteemed worthy of an especial
confidence, were called ἀργεῖοι;<a id="noteref_160" name="noteref_160" href="#note_160"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">160</span></span></a> the ἐρυκτῆρες
enjoyed the same in war: the ἀφέται were probably
released from all service. The δεσποσιοναῦται, who
served in the fleet, resembled probably the freed-men
of Attica, who were called the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">out-dwellers</span></span> (ἱ χωρὶς

same time a portion of land was granted to them without the lot of their
former masters. After they had been in possession of
liberty for some time, they appear to have been called
<span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">Neodamodes</span></span>,<a id="noteref_163" name="noteref_163" href="#note_163"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">163</span></span></a> the number of whom soon came near

also, were not Periœci (of whose elevation to the rank
of Spartans we know nothing), but Helots, who, being
brought up together with the young Spartans (like
Eumæus in the house of Ulysses), obtained freedom
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page044">[pg 044]</span><a name="Pg044" id="Pg044" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
without the rights of citizenship.<a id="noteref_165" name="noteref_165" href="#note_165"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">165</span></span></a> For μόθων means

6. The number of the Helots may be determined
with sufficient accuracy from the account of the army
at Platæa. We find that there were present in this
battle 5000 Spartans, 35,000 Helots, and 10,000
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page045">[pg 045]</span><a name="Pg045" id="Pg045" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Periœci.<a id="noteref_169" name="noteref_169" href="#note_169"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">169</span></span></a>
The whole number of Spartans that bore
arms, amounted on another occasion to 8000, which,
according to the same proportion, would give 56,000
for the number of Helots capable of bearing arms,
and for the whole population about 224,000. If then
the state of Sparta possessed 9000 lots there were
twenty male Helots to each (although, as we saw
above, a single lot could probably maintain a larger
number), and there remained 44,000 for the service of
the state and of individuals. The account of Thucydides,
that the Chians had the greatest number of
slaves of any one state after the Lacedæmonians,<a id="noteref_170" name="noteref_170" href="#note_170"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">170</span></span></a> does
not compel us to set the amount higher, because the
great number of slaves in Ægina disappeared when
that island lost its freedom, and Athens during the
Peloponnesian war certainly did not possess 200,000
slaves. The number of Periœci able to bear arms
would, according to the above proportion, only amount
to 16,000; but we must suppose that a larger portion
of them remained behind in Peloponnesus: for since
the Periœci were possessed of 30,000 lots (though of
less extent), there must have been about the same
number of families, and we thus get at least 120,000
men; and upon the whole, for the 3800 square miles
of Laconia, a suitable population of 380,000 souls.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
From this calculation it also results, that, according
to the population to be maintained, the estates of the
Spartans (πολιτικὴ χώρα)<a id="noteref_171" name="noteref_171" href="#note_171"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">171</span></span></a> must have amounted to
two-thirds of all the tillage-land in the country. This
arrangement could not have been attended with any
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page046">[pg 046]</span><a name="Pg046" id="Pg046" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
difficulty after the conquest of the fertile territory of
Messenia, when the number of lots was doubled,<a id="noteref_172" name="noteref_172" href="#note_172"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">172</span></span></a> and
the area of each was perhaps increased in a still greater
proportion. For when the Spartans had (as it appears)
dislodged the Doric Messenians, and conquered
their country, a few maritime and inland towns
(Asine, Mothone, Thuria, and Æthæa) were indeed
suffered to remain in the possession of Periœci; but
the best part of a country so rich in tillage-land, plantations,
and pastures,<a id="noteref_173" name="noteref_173" href="#note_173"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">173</span></span></a> passed into the hands of Spartan
proprietors, and the husbandmen who remained
behind became Helots.<a id="noteref_174" name="noteref_174" href="#note_174"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">174</span></span></a> It was these last in particular
who, during the great earthquake in 465 B.C.,
took possession of the towns of Thuria and Æthæa,
fortified the strong hold of Ithome, and afterwards
partially emigrated.<a id="noteref_175" name="noteref_175" href="#note_175"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">175</span></span></a> If however this insurrection
had been common to all the Helots, as Diodorus relates,
how could the Spartans have afterwards allowed
the insurgents to withdraw from the country, without
entirely depriving the land of its cultivators? After
the battle of Leuctra also, it was not the Laconian, but
the Messenian Helots who revolted,<a id="noteref_176" name="noteref_176" href="#note_176"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">176</span></span></a> and were without

7. In Laconia itself, according to the Rhetra of
Agis (which in all probability merely confirmed existing
institutions), the territory belonging to Sparta
consisted of the inland tract, which was bounded by
part of mount Taygetus to the west, by the river
Pellene, and by Sellasia to the north, and extended
eastward towards Malea,<a id="noteref_178" name="noteref_178" href="#note_178"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">178</span></span></a> and this was therefore at
that time cultivated by Helots. Here it may be
asked, who were the inhabitants of the towns situated
in this district, for example Amyclæ, Therapne, and
Pharis? Certainly not Helots alone, for there were a
considerable number of Hoplitæ from Amyclæ in the
Lacedæmonian army,<a id="noteref_179" name="noteref_179" href="#note_179"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">179</span></span></a> who must therefore have
been either Spartans or Periœci. But whether the Periœci
inhabited small districts in the midst of the territory
immediately occupied by the Spartans, or whether
some Spartans lived out of the city in country-towns,
cannot be completely determined. The former is,
however, the more probable, since some Periœci lived
in the vicinity of the city,<a id="noteref_180" name="noteref_180" href="#note_180"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">180</span></span></a> and Amyclæ is reckoned
among the towns of Laconia;<a id="noteref_181" name="noteref_181" href="#note_181"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">181</span></span></a> the Spartans also are
mentioned to have had dwellings in the country,<a id="noteref_182" name="noteref_182" href="#note_182"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">182</span></span></a> but
never to have possessed houses in any other town except
Sparta, and a few villages in the neighbourhood.

difficult problem, of what is the proper signification
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page048">[pg 048]</span><a name="Pg048" id="Pg048" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

Further, it is clear from ancient writers that Pitana,
Limnæ, Mesoa, and Cynosura, were names of places.
We are best informed with respect to Pitana, an
ancient town, and without doubt anterior to the
Dorians,<a id="noteref_190" name="noteref_190" href="#note_190"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">190</span></span></a> which was of sufficient importance to have

the town.<a id="noteref_195" name="noteref_195" href="#note_195"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">195</span></span></a> This author also mentions, in the same district
of the city, the porch of the Crotanes, who were a

Pitana lay to the west of Sparta, outside the town according

a part of the town, as also was Mesoa,<a id="noteref_198" name="noteref_198" href="#note_198"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">198</span></span></a> whither however

1. After having thus separately considered the
two dependent classes in Sparta, the pattern state of
the Dorians, we will now point out the traces of the
analogous ranks in several other states of Doric origin.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Doric customs were first established in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Crete</span></span>,
whose fortunate circumstances had given to that race a
fertile country, and an undisturbed dominion. Accordingly,
the relative rights of the Dorians and natives
must at an early period have been fixed on a settled
basis in this island; and we may suppose that this
settlement was made on equitable terms, since Aristotle
was not aware of any insurrection of the slaves in
Crete against their masters.<a id="noteref_201" name="noteref_201" href="#note_201"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">201</span></span></a> The Doric customs required
here, as elsewhere, exemption from all agricultural
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page051">[pg 051]</span><a name="Pg051" id="Pg051" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
or commercial industry; which is expressed in
a lively manner in the song of Hybrias the Cretan,
that <span class="tei tei-q">“with lance and sword and shield he reaped and
dressed his vines, and hence was called lord of the
Mnoia.”</span><a id="noteref_202" name="noteref_202" href="#note_202"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">202</span></span></a> In this island, however, different classes
of dependents must have existed. Sosicrates and
Dosiadas, both credible authors on the affairs of Crete,
speak of three classes, the public bondsmen (κοινὴ
δουλεία), called by the Cretans μνοΐα, the slaves of individual
citizens, ἀφαμιῶται, and the Periœci, ὑπήκοοι.
Now we know that the Aphamiotæ received their
name from the cultivation of the lands of private individuals
(in Cretan ἀφαμίαι) and accordingly they
were agricultural bondsmen.<a id="noteref_203" name="noteref_203" href="#note_203"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">203</span></span></a> These latter are identical
with the Clarotæ, who, for this reason, were not
separately mentioned by the writers just quoted: for
although they are generally supposed to have taken
their name from the lot cast for prisoners of war, the
more natural derivation doubtless is from the lots or
lands of the citizens, which were called κλῆροι. But
whichever explanation we adopt, they were bondsmen
belonging to the individual citizens. Both the Clarotæ
and Aphamiotæ have therefore been correctly compared
with the Helots;<a id="noteref_204" name="noteref_204" href="#note_204"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">204</span></span></a> and as the latter were entirely
distinct from the Laconian Periœci, so were the
former from the Cretan, although Aristotle neglects
the distinction accurately observed by the Cretan
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page052">[pg 052]</span><a name="Pg052" id="Pg052" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
writers.<a id="noteref_205" name="noteref_205" href="#note_205"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">205</span></span></a> In the second place,
the μνοία (or μνῴα) was
by more precise historians distinguished as well from
the condition of Periœci as from that of private bondage,
and it was explained to mean a state of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">public
villenage</span></em>; whence we may infer that every state in
Crete was possessed of public lands, which the Mnotæ
cultivated in the same relative situation to the community
in which the Aphamiotæ, who cultivated the
allotted estates, stood to the several proprietors. This
name, however, is sometimes extended to all forced
labourers, as in the song of Hybrias noticed above.<a id="noteref_206" name="noteref_206" href="#note_206"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">206</span></span></a>
Finally, the Periœci formed in Crete, as in Laconia,
dependent and tributary communities: their tribute
was, like the produce of the national lands, partly
applied to the public banquets;<a id="noteref_207" name="noteref_207" href="#note_207"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">207</span></span></a> to which also, according
to Dosiadas,<a id="noteref_208" name="noteref_208" href="#note_208"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">208</span></span></a> every slave in Lyctus
contributed in addition one Æginetan stater. Now in this passage
we cannot suppose that the Periœci are meant, because
the exact author would not have called them
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page053">[pg 053]</span><a name="Pg053" id="Pg053" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
slaves: nor yet the slaves purchased in foreign parts
(called ἀργυρώνητοι in Crete), since it would have
been impossible to reckon with any certainty that persons
in this situation possessed anything of their own;
nor, lastly, can the Mnotæ be meant, since these were
public slaves, having no connexion with individuals,
nor consequently with their eating clubs.<a id="noteref_209" name="noteref_209" href="#note_209"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">209</span></span></a> It remains,
therefore, that it was the Clarotæ (or Aphamiotæ),
who, in addition to the tax in kind, were also liable to
this payment in money, with which utensils for the
use of the public table were probably purchased. It
may be, moreover, observed that we have no reason to
suppose that the bondsmen were admitted to the daily
banquets.<a id="noteref_210" name="noteref_210" href="#note_210"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">210</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Perhaps, however, there was no Grecian state in
which the dependent classes were so little oppressed
as in Crete. In general, every employment and profession,
with the exception of the gymnasia and military
service, was permitted to them.<a id="noteref_211" name="noteref_211" href="#note_211"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">211</span></span></a> Hence
also the Periœci held so firmly to the ancient legislation of
Minos, that they even then observed it, when it had been neglected
by the Dorians of the town of Lyctus;<a id="noteref_212" name="noteref_212" href="#note_212"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">212</span></span></a>
and thus, as was frequently the case elsewhere, in the
decline of public manners the ancient customs were
retained among the lower classes of society longer than
amongst the higher. Upon the whole, Crete was the
most fortunate of all the Doric states in this circumstance,
that it could follow up its own institutions with
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page054">[pg 054]</span><a name="Pg054" id="Pg054" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
energy and in quiet, without any powerful obstacle;
although its very tranquillity and far-extended commerce
at length occasioned a gradual decline of ancient
customs. The reverse took place at Argos, whose
Doric inhabitants, pressed on all sides, were at length
compelled to renounce the institutions of their race,
and adopt those of the natives. In the early history of
this state, therefore, the two classes of dependents and
bondsmen should be distinguished: this division was,
however, very early laid aside, and an entirely different
arrangement introduced.

2. There was at <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Argos</span></span> a class of bond-slaves,
who are compared with the Helots, and were called
<span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">Gymnesii</span></span>.<a id="noteref_213" name="noteref_213" href="#note_213"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">213</span></span></a> The name alone sufficiently proves the
correctness of the comparison; these slaves having
evidently been the light-armed attendants on their
masters (γύμνητες). Hence also the same class of
slaves were in Sicyon called κορυνηφύροι; because they
only carried a club or staff, and not, like the heavy-armed
Dorians, a sword and lance. It is to these Gymnesii
that the account of Herodotus refers,<a id="noteref_214" name="noteref_214" href="#note_214"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">214</span></span></a> that 6000
of the citizens of Argos having been slain in battle by
Cleomenes king of Sparta,<a id="noteref_215" name="noteref_215" href="#note_215"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">215</span></span></a> the slaves got the government
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page055">[pg 055]</span><a name="Pg055" id="Pg055" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
into their own hands, and retained possession of
it until the sons of those who had fallen were grown
to manhood. From this narrative it is plain that the
number of Dorians at Argos was nearly exhausted by
the death of 6000 of their body; and that none but
bondsmen dwelt in the immediate neighbourhood of the
city, since otherwise the sovereign power would not
have fallen into their hands. It would be absurd to
suppose that slaves bought in foreign countries can be
here intended, since these could have had no more notion
of governing a Grecian state than the bear in the
fable of managing the ship.<a id="noteref_216" name="noteref_216" href="#note_216"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">216</span></span></a> Afterwards, when the
young citizens had grown up, the slaves were compelled
by them to withdraw to Tiryns; and then,
after a long war, as it appears, were either driven from
the territory, or again subdued.<a id="noteref_217" name="noteref_217" href="#note_217"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">217</span></span></a>

The Argives, however, also had Periœci,<a id="noteref_218" name="noteref_218" href="#note_218"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">218</span></span></a>
who were known by the name of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Orneatæ</span></span>. This appellation
was properly applied to the inhabitants of Orneæ, a
town on the frontiers towards Mantinea, which, having
been long independent, was at last, about the year 580
B.C.,<a id="noteref_219" name="noteref_219" href="#note_219"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">219</span></span></a> reduced by the Argives; and
afterwards the whole class of Periœci was so called from that place.
These Orneatæ, or Periœci, therefore, like those of
Laconia, formed separate communities of their own,
which indeed was the case so late as the Persian war.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page056">[pg 056]</span><a name="Pg056" id="Pg056" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
For (as we have shown above) the Argives about this
time incorporated the surrounding towns belonging to
the Periœci,<a id="noteref_220" name="noteref_220" href="#note_220"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">220</span></span></a> for the purpose of replenishing and increasing
their own numbers, and gave them the rights
of citizens. With this period an entirely new era in
the history of the constitution of Argos commences,
although this state of things has from its greater notoriety
often been improperly applied also to earlier
times. Thus Isocrates<a id="noteref_221" name="noteref_221" href="#note_221"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">221</span></span></a> says that the Dorians of
Argos, like those of Messene, admitted the native inhabitants
into the city (as σύνοικοι), and gave them
equal rights of citizenship, with the exception of
offices of honour; contrasting with it the conduct of
the Spartans, in a manner which every one now perceives
to have been entirely groundless. The change
in the constitution of Argos then introduced was no
less than if the whole body of Periœci in Laconia had
declared themselves the sovereign community. For
the newly-adopted citizens appear to have soon demanded
and obtained the full rights of the old; and
hence, ever after the above epoch, democracy seems to
have had the upper hand in Argos. And this could
never be the case without the disappearance of the
Doric character, which showed itself in the diminution
of their military skill. For this reason the Argives in
after-times were reduced to form a standing army of
a thousand citizens, of noble extraction, under the
command of generals who possessed great civil power.<a id="noteref_222" name="noteref_222" href="#note_222"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">222</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page057">[pg 057]</span><a name="Pg057" id="Pg057" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
This body of men, however, immediately endeavoured
to set up an oppressive oligarchy, until they at length
yielded to the preponderating power of the democracy.
But of this more hereafter.<a id="noteref_223" name="noteref_223" href="#note_223"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">223</span></span></a>

merely a term of reproach. That this class, however,
as at Argos, furnished citizens who were not originally
Dorians, is shown by the occurrence of a fourth tribe,
besides the three Doric.<a id="noteref_225" name="noteref_225" href="#note_225"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">225</span></span></a>

does there appear to have been any complete distinction between
the Doric and other races. The inhabitants, especially
those of the former state, must have lived on an equality
with the aboriginal possessors, and were probably
only admitted by a fresh division (ἐπ᾽ ἀναδασμῷ) to a
joint possession of the lands. Hence it was that in
Corinth there were not only the three Doric tribes (of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page058">[pg 058]</span><a name="Pg058" id="Pg058" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
which we shall speak hereafter), but eight, all of which
dwelt in the city.<a id="noteref_226" name="noteref_226" href="#note_226"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">226</span></span></a> Nor were even the Cypselidæ
Dorians; though, before they obtained the tyranny,
they had long been distinguished citizens. We may
discover a class of Corinthian Helots in the Cynophali,<a id="noteref_227" name="noteref_227" href="#note_227"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">227</span></span></a>
whose name was, as in a former instance, derived from
the dog-skin cap of the native Peloponnesians. But
regular slavery, as was natural in a commercial state,
soon prevailed at Corinth, and probably under very
nearly the same form as at Athens.<a id="noteref_228" name="noteref_228" href="#note_228"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">228</span></span></a> In Sicyon there
were bondsmen, of whom the names Corynephori<a id="noteref_229" name="noteref_229" href="#note_229"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">229</span></span></a> and

them as light-armed attendants in war, the second as a
class always inhabiting the country. The citizens of
this state were divided into four tribes, of which three
were purely Doric, viz., the Hylleans, Dymanes, and
Pamphylians; while the fourth tribe, the Ægialeans,
derived their name from the country which they had
inhabited before the Doric invasion.<a id="noteref_231" name="noteref_231" href="#note_231"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">231</span></span></a> It is also certain
that this fourth tribe possessed not merely some
civil privileges, but the complete rights of citizenship;
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page059">[pg 059]</span><a name="Pg059" id="Pg059" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
since the family of Cleisthenes raised itself from it to
the royal dignity, which could scarcely have taken
place had their tribe stood in the same relation to the
citizens as the Periœci or Helots did to the Spartans.
This Cleisthenes, with the arrogance of a tyrant, gave
to his own tribe the name of Archelai, or rulers; while
he called the three Doric tribes after the sow, the
swine, and the ass (ὑᾶται, ὀνεᾶται, χοιρεᾶται.) We can
hardly, however, credit the assertion of Herodotus (who
too often seeks for the causes of events in the passions
and wishes of individuals, to the disregard of political
circumstances) that these were merely terms of abuse;<a id="noteref_232" name="noteref_232" href="#note_232"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">232</span></span></a>
it is more probable that Cleisthenes wished to compel
the Dorians to retire into the country, and employ
themselves in the care of cattle and in agriculture, thus
bidding an entire defiance to all their principles. But
so arbitrary a subversion of all ancient customs and
habits could not endure for any length of time; and,
after the downfall of that tyrannical dynasty, the former
constitution was restored in its most essential
parts.

4. In the colonies of the Dorians the condition
of the conquered peasants and bondsmen was often
more oppressed and degraded than in the parent
states; since the ruling class were there placed in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page060">[pg 060]</span><a name="Pg060" id="Pg060" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
contact, not with Greeks, but with barbarians. In
their settlements the following ranks were generally
formed at successive periods of time. A Doric state
founded the colony; and its citizens constituted the
sole nobility in the new city; these parted amongst
themselves the conquered land into lots,<a id="noteref_233" name="noteref_233" href="#note_233"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">233</span></span></a> and formed
the body of citizens, the πολίτευμα strictly so
called.<a id="noteref_234" name="noteref_234" href="#note_234"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">234</span></span></a>
These colonists, however, soon endeavoured to
strengthen themselves by fresh numbers, and opened
their harbours to all exiled or discontented persons.
The motley population<a id="noteref_235" name="noteref_235" href="#note_235"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">235</span></span></a> thus formed, called by the
name of <span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">Demus</span></span>, was generally excluded from the
body politic (or the πολίτευμα), until it obtained
admittance by force; and at the same time constantly
pressed for a new division of the territory (ἀναδασμὸς).<a id="noteref_236" name="noteref_236" href="#note_236"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">236</span></span></a>
Besides these, a third rank was formed by
the native inhabitants, who were compelled by the
new-comers to serve either as bondsmen or public
slaves. Thus, for example, the distinction at <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Syracuse</span></span>
was—first, the Gamori, viz., the old Corinthian
colonists, who had taken possession of the large lots,
and divided the land;<a id="noteref_237" name="noteref_237" href="#note_237"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">237</span></span></a> secondly, a Demus; and,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page061">[pg 061]</span><a name="Pg061" id="Pg061" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
thirdly, slaves on the estates of the nobles, whose
number became proverbial. These were, without
doubt, native Siculians, as is shown by the various
forms of their name (Κυλλύριοι, Κιλλικύριοι, Καλλικύριοι,)
which cannot be explained from the Greek.<a id="noteref_238" name="noteref_238" href="#note_238"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">238</span></span></a>
The political condition of Syracuse was formed in a
manner essentially different from that of the Peloponnesian
states, chiefly from the circumstance that
the Demus (an <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">unpleasant fellow-lodger</span></span>, according to
the expression of Gelon) was immediately received
into the city. Hence also the prodigious size of the
Sicilian and Italian towns in comparison with those of
Peloponnesus. The Gamori, together with their
Cyllyrians, stood in nearly the same relation to the
Demus as the patricians with their clients did to the
plebeians at Rome. The changes in the constitution
also had nearly the same course as at Rome; for the
two classes first sought to compromise their pretensions
in a moderate timocracy (the πολιτεία of Aristotle),
which subsequently passed (as we shall see
hereafter) into a complete democracy.

5. In the Megarian colony of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Byzantium</span></span> the
native inhabitants, the Bithynians, were in precisely
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page062">[pg 062]</span><a name="Pg062" id="Pg062" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the same condition as the Helots.<a id="noteref_239" name="noteref_239" href="#note_239"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">239</span></span></a> The same was

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Heraclea on the Pontus</span></span>, which city also was
founded by the Megarians conjointly with the Bœotians.
They submitted under the stipulation that no Mariandynian
should be sold beyond the borders,<a id="noteref_240" name="noteref_240" href="#note_240"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">240</span></span></a>
which was a fundamental rule of the ancient system
of bondage; and that they should pay a tribute to be
settled once for all, this being called by the mild
name of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">presents</span></span> (δῶρα<a id="noteref_241" name="noteref_241" href="#note_241"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">241</span></span></a>). The great number of
these native slaves, who never suffered the country to
want for sailors, was very favourable to the commerce
and naval power of Heraclea.<a id="noteref_242" name="noteref_242" href="#note_242"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">242</span></span></a>

At <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Cyrene</span></span> also the several classes were formed
in a similar manner. In Thera, the mother-country
of Cyrene, the families of the original colony from
Laconia had once alone possessed the full rights of
citizenship, and held the offices of state.<a id="noteref_243" name="noteref_243" href="#note_243"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">243</span></span></a> Thus also
at Cyrene the families from Thera at first were sole
possessors of the governing power, and did not admit
the after-comers to a full participation of it. It was
the natural course of events, that they who first caused
the Grecian name to be respected amongst the savages
of Libya should be supposed to have a greater claim
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page063">[pg 063]</span><a name="Pg063" id="Pg063" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to honour and property than those who had flocked
together to a town already established and securely
defended. But the Cyrenæans having in the reign of
Battus the Second proclaimed throughout Greece a
new division of their lands<a id="noteref_244" name="noteref_244" href="#note_244"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">244</span></span></a> (which, however, they
had first to gain from the Libyans), and many fresh
citizens having collected together, a new constitution
became in time necessary: and this, Demonax of
Mantinea established for them on democratic principles.
He abolished the old tribes, and created in
their place three new ones, in which the entire Grecian
population of Cyrene was comprehended. The division
of the people was into three parts, viz., one consisting
of the Theræans and Periœci, the second of
Peloponnesians and Cretans, and the third of all the
islanders.<a id="noteref_245" name="noteref_245" href="#note_245"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">245</span></span></a> From this it is evident that the original
colonists still continued to keep Periœci under their
power, while the other citizens did not enjoy this
right; and that the former were a kind of privileged
class, who probably were in a great measure relieved
from any personal attendance to agriculture: in this
manner the wise Demonax respected the institutions
of antiquity. Of the origin and condition of these
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page064">[pg 064]</span><a name="Pg064" id="Pg064" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

different subject classes in the Doric states. It has
been clearly proved that a class of Periœci, and also
of Helots, was the basis of the Doric form of government,
insomuch that the abolition of servitude generally
occasioned a subversion of the Doric institutions.
Hence the Dorians generally, and above all the Spartans,
were distinguished for the obstinacy with which
they retained it. But this species of servitude may
be said to have existed in ancient times, wherever a
warlike nation had obtained a settlement by conquest;
for example, in Thessaly, Bœotia, and even
among the Ionians of Athens. Now as the distinction
of subjects and bond-slaves was kept up for
a longer time in Thessaly than in any other state,
those of the Dorians alone being excepted, we will
include that country in the present inquiry. The
following classes may be there distinguished: First,
a number of small nations were under the dominion of
the Thessalians, to whom they paid a fixed tribute,
and were also probably bound to assist in war; but
they nevertheless still retained their national divisions,
and a certain degree of independence. This must
have been the state of the Perrhæbians to the north
of Larissa, the Magnesians to the east of mount Pelion,
and the Phthiotan Achæans to the south of mount
Othrys and the Enipeus. For all these were indeed
subject to the Thessalians,<a id="noteref_246" name="noteref_246" href="#note_246"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">246</span></span></a> but had not ceased to be
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page065">[pg 065]</span><a name="Pg065" id="Pg065" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
distinct, nay, even Amphictyonic nations.<a id="noteref_247" name="noteref_247" href="#note_247"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">247</span></span></a> Their tribute
had been accurately fixed by Scopas, prince of
Pharsalus. They were also called Periœci.<a id="noteref_248" name="noteref_248" href="#note_248"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">248</span></span></a> Excluding
then this tract of country, we retain for Thessaly
Proper the region between the Perrhæbians towards
the north, and the Achæans towards the south,
in which direction the Enipeus forms the boundary,<a id="noteref_249" name="noteref_249" href="#note_249"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">249</span></span></a>
comprehending the valley of the Peneus (the ancient
Pelasgic Argos), and a district towards the Pagasæan
bay, called by Herodotus Æolis.<a id="noteref_250" name="noteref_250" href="#note_250"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">250</span></span></a> The Thessalians,
therefore, held this territory under their immediate
government, and had the towns of Larissa, Crannon,
Pharsalus, Iolcus, and others, in their own possession;
the land being cultivated by the Penestæ, who were
the early Pelasgico-Æolian inhabitants.<a id="noteref_251" name="noteref_251" href="#note_251"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">251</span></span></a> For, according
to Archemachus,<a id="noteref_252" name="noteref_252" href="#note_252"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">252</span></span></a> the Æolian Bœotians had
in part emigrated from their country, leaving some of
their numbers behind, who submitted conditionally, as
Penestæ: amongst these Theopompus<a id="noteref_253" name="noteref_253" href="#note_253"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">253</span></span></a> also
includes the Magnesians and Perrhæbians; but this statement
can only hold good of a part of these two races, since
they were (as has been already shown) dependent, but
not entirely subject.<a id="noteref_254" name="noteref_254" href="#note_254"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">254</span></span></a> The fundamental laws of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page066">[pg 066]</span><a name="Pg066" id="Pg066" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
ancient Greek bondage applied also to the Penestæ.
They could neither be put to death without trial, nor
be sold out of the country.<a id="noteref_255" name="noteref_255" href="#note_255"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">255</span></span></a> Thus they stood in an
intermediate position between freemen and purchased
slaves,<a id="noteref_256" name="noteref_256" href="#note_256"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">256</span></span></a> like the Mariandynians of Heraclea, the
Clarotæ of Crete, and the Helots of Laconia, with whom
they are generally compared.<a id="noteref_257" name="noteref_257" href="#note_257"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">257</span></span></a> For, like these, they
were reduced to servitude by conquest, although they
cannot properly be called slaves taken in war.<a id="noteref_258" name="noteref_258" href="#note_258"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">258</span></span></a> Further,
they were not subject to the whole community,
but belonged to particular houses and families:<a id="noteref_259" name="noteref_259" href="#note_259"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">259</span></span></a> hence
also they were called Θεσσαλοικέται.<a id="noteref_260" name="noteref_260" href="#note_260"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">260</span></span></a> They were
particularly numerous in the great families of the
Aleuadæ and Scopadæ.<a id="noteref_261" name="noteref_261" href="#note_261"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">261</span></span></a> Their principal employment
was agriculture,<a id="noteref_262" name="noteref_262" href="#note_262"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">262</span></span></a> from the produce of which
they paid a rent to the proprietors of the soil.<a id="noteref_263" name="noteref_263" href="#note_263"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">263</span></span></a> At
the same time this did not prevent them from gaining
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page067">[pg 067]</span><a name="Pg067" id="Pg067" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
property of their own, and they were frequently richer
than their masters.<a id="noteref_264" name="noteref_264" href="#note_264"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">264</span></span></a> In war they attended their lords,
protecting and fighting before them, like knights and
their squires; generally, however, contrary to the custom
of other Greeks, on horseback.<a id="noteref_265" name="noteref_265" href="#note_265"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">265</span></span></a> All these accounts
respecting the Penestæ agree sufficiently well
with one another, and refer to one and the same class;
although it is certain that the attempts to obtain civil
liberty had much increased amongst the Penestæ at
the time of the Peloponnesian war, and were now and
then, though not constantly, supported by Athens.<a id="noteref_266" name="noteref_266" href="#note_266"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">266</span></span></a> The other internal affairs of the Thessalians do not
lie within the range of our inquiry. They had little
adapted themselves to a quiet course of events, nor indeed
did the turbulent and haughty disposition of their
race allow of a life of inactivity. In each town of
Thessaly we find a constant struggle between the
commons and a number of oligarchical families; from
these arise several princely races, such as the Aleuadæ,
Scopadæ,<a id="noteref_267" name="noteref_267" href="#note_267"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">267</span></span></a> &amp;c. The states themselves were generally
at war with one another: thus their political
constitution, as well as the want of steadiness and forbearance
in the national character, must be regarded
as the chief reasons why Thessaly was of so little importance
in Greece. The external means which a
wide territory and military power afforded them were
here doubtless present in a greater degree than in any
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page068">[pg 068]</span><a name="Pg068" id="Pg068" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
other country; the Thessalians were also distinguished
for their bravery, and the ancient fame of the country
would have supported claims in themselves well
founded; how came it then that the history of Thessaly
was a blank in the annals of Greece, while Sparta
was so long its very soul? The only answer is, that
the national character of the Thessalians was altogether
different; for wisdom they had only cunning;
for rational valour only a restless love of war; for
strict self-command only unrestrained passions.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
7. It appears, therefore, that foreign conquest universally
in Greece gave birth to that political condition,
which may be compared with the villenage or serfage
of the Germanic nations; and indeed it does not seem
that such a state of society could have any other origin.
There would accordingly be matter for surprise if we
found a class of bondsmen among the Arcadians, a
nation which neither gained its territory by conquest,<a id="noteref_268" name="noteref_268" href="#note_268"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">268</span></span></a>
nor was ever conquered itself: and, accordingly, it
can scarcely be doubted that the nation described by
Theopompus as possessing 300,000 Prospelatæ, whom
he compares with the Helots, is not the Arcadians,
but the Illyrian Ardiæans.<a id="noteref_269" name="noteref_269" href="#note_269"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">269</span></span></a> The distinction of ranks,
which we find existing in the Arcadian towns, may be
satisfactorily explained by the opposition between the
city, properly so called (πόλις), and the country villages
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page069">[pg 069]</span><a name="Pg069" id="Pg069" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
(δῆμοι, κῶμαι), which in later times most of the
Arcadian cities, for example, Mantinea, Tegea, and
Heræa, incorporated with themselves. For although
it is asserted that these and other towns were made up
of separate villages, it must not be supposed that they
had no previous existence as cities. The account is
to be understood in the same manner as that of the
congregating of the people of Attica to Athens, which
is stated to have taken place in the time of Theseus.
Nearly all the towns of Arcadia possessed citadels of
extreme antiquity, in and near which many princely,
sacerdotal, and military families had dwelt from an
early period. These formed a nobility, with reference
to the agricultural classes in the country, which, however,
included by far the greater portion of the Arcadians.
If then one large town was formed of several
villages, the constitution at the same time necessarily
became more democratical, which was the result at
Argos of the incorporation of the Periœci,<a id="noteref_270" name="noteref_270" href="#note_270"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">270</span></span></a> and at
Megara also of the same measure.<a id="noteref_271" name="noteref_271" href="#note_271"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">271</span></span></a> For so long as
the people inhabited a particular village, they interested
themselves in its affairs alone, and the persons
in the chief city managed the concerns of the whole
community. But from the moment that they began
to live together, every person considered himself entitled
to a share in the public councils. Hence it was
the interest of the head of the Peloponnesian confederacy
again to separate the inhabitants of the towns
(διοικίζειν); of the Athenians, to keep them together.
The Argives first effected the union of the boroughs
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page070">[pg 070]</span><a name="Pg070" id="Pg070" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
at Mantinea, doubtless not until they had seen other
instances of the same proceeding, that is, after the
Persian war. They united four hamlets with the ancient
city,<a id="noteref_272" name="noteref_272" href="#note_272"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">272</span></span></a> which made the fifth; the Lacedæmonians
after some time restored the ancient villages, and with
them the aristocracy. The territory of Tegea was
also divided into eight hamlets, which were afterwards
united to make the city, viz., the Gareatæ, Phylaceans,
Caryatæ,<a id="noteref_273" name="noteref_273" href="#note_273"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">273</span></span></a> Corytheans, Botachidæ, Manthyreans, Echeneteans,
and Apheidantes: to these were added, as the
ninth, the Tegeatans of the ancient town,<a id="noteref_274" name="noteref_274" href="#note_274"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">274</span></span></a> who had
previously been the citizens properly so called, while
the former had been the inhabitants of the open country;
a distinction, which, upon their union, must
either instantly or very soon have disappeared.

8. Since it has been ascertained in the course of
these inquiries that the distinction between πόλις
and δῆμος, that is, town and country, was of great
political importance in the ancient states, we will conclude
this chapter with some remarks upon those
terms.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The word δῆμος originally signified the ground and
soil on which the people lived,<a id="noteref_275" name="noteref_275" href="#note_275"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">275</span></span></a> and afterwards the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page071">[pg 071]</span><a name="Pg071" id="Pg071" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
whole number of persons inhabiting it. Πόλις, on
the contrary, means the city, which in the time of
Homer was probably always fortified. Now with the
city everything that concerned the government of a
state was connected, and those exempt from all personal
share in the labours of the field, namely, the
military families and the nobles,<a id="noteref_276" name="noteref_276" href="#note_276"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">276</span></span></a>
dwelt in it; hence it is viewed in Homer as a disgrace or a misfortune, for
a noble to live among the bondsmen in the country.<a id="noteref_277" name="noteref_277" href="#note_277"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">277</span></span></a>
This is the state of things described by the most ancient
poet; and particular accounts of an historical
nature present the same picture. When the Achæans
settled on the coast of Ægialea, they fortified themselves
in the towns and strongholds, and kept entirely
aloof from the natives; at least we know this to have
been the case at Patræ;<a id="noteref_278" name="noteref_278" href="#note_278"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">278</span></span></a> so that the same
race here inhabited the principal city as conquerors, who in
Laconia were scattered about in the country-towns as
a conquered people. Hence also the town of Dyme
was originally called
<span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">Stratos</span></span>;<a id="noteref_279" name="noteref_279" href="#note_279"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">279</span></span></a> that is, the station of
the army, the abode of the male population who had
the means and the privilege of bearing arms. It was
not till a later period that the Achæan towns, Patræ,
Dyme, and Ægium, incorporated their villages.<a id="noteref_280" name="noteref_280" href="#note_280"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">280</span></span></a> At
Athens the Eupatridæ are stated to have had possession
of the city;<a id="noteref_281" name="noteref_281" href="#note_281"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">281</span></span></a> an account which is strikingly
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page072">[pg 072]</span><a name="Pg072" id="Pg072" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
confirmed by the circumstance that Cydathenæum, one
of the Attic demi, was situated within the city,<a id="noteref_282" name="noteref_282" href="#note_282"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">282</span></span></a> and
it had evidently taken its name from Cydathenæus, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a noble and illustrious Athenian</span></em>.<a id="noteref_283" name="noteref_283" href="#note_283"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">283</span></span></a> Hence is explained
the distinction between the terms <span class="tei tei-q">“Athenian,”</span> and
<span class="tei tei-q">“inhabitant of Attica (Ἀττικὸς),”</span> which was still
preserved in common language after it had been in
fact abolished by the democracy. Thus Plato uses
the former, as a more honourable appellation than the
latter;<a id="noteref_284" name="noteref_284" href="#note_284"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">284</span></span></a> and when Dicæarchus, describing the
manners of Greece, contrasts the inhabitants of Attica as
loquacious, sycophantic, and fickle, with the noble-minded,
simple, and honest Athenians, by the latter he
means the ancient families, and by the former the
Demus, which, since the time of Cleisthenes, had been
compounded of the most heterogeneous elements.
Thus the πόλις and δῆμος became identical in Athens,
and the latter word was used by preference to signify
the whole community. But in other states, the πόλις
was opposed to the δῆμος, as the ruling aristocratical
power.<a id="noteref_285" name="noteref_285" href="#note_285"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">285</span></span></a> Thus Theognis the Megarian says of his
native town, with aristocratical feelings—
</p>

</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Hence, also, states not under a democratical government
used the word πόλις in their public documents,
to signify the sovereign power; for instance, the Cretan
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page073">[pg 073]</span><a name="Pg073" id="Pg073" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
towns, so late as the second century after Christ.<a id="noteref_287" name="noteref_287" href="#note_287"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">287</span></span></a> The
Spartan community, however, deviating from this
usage of the word, calls itself δᾶμος in ancient laws;<a id="noteref_288" name="noteref_288" href="#note_288"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">288</span></span></a>
because it never thought of opposing itself as a body
to the Periœci.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Democracies then were frequently formed by collecting
the inhabitants of the country into the city
(when the δῆμος and πόλις coincided), by the union of
single villages, and by the admission of the Periœci to
the rights of citizenship. At Athens, in order to give
the democracy the highest possible antiquity, this
change was dated as far back as the mythical age of
Theseus. In Peloponnesus, the first movements tending
to it had perhaps begun before the time of the
tyrants; these very persons, however, though they had
in most cases risen from demagogues, still, for the
purpose of securing a more tranquil dominion, sought
again to remove the common people from the city, and
to bind them down to the country. Instead of the
town-costume, they forced them to resume their former
dress of sheep's skins, as has been remarked above of
the tyrants of Sicyon;<a id="noteref_289" name="noteref_289" href="#note_289"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">289</span></span></a> for this purpose likewise they
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page074">[pg 074]</span><a name="Pg074" id="Pg074" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
very prudently encouraged agriculture in all its
branches.<a id="noteref_290" name="noteref_290" href="#note_290"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">290</span></span></a> Trade and commerce, by
collecting men together in large towns, promoted the principles of democracy.
It was in the wealthy and populous cities
of the Greeks in the Ionian territory that a popular
government was first established. Where, on the
other hand, the courts of justice were at a distance,
and there was no other inducement to mechanical industry
and internal commerce, the ancient habits of
life continued much longer in existence; as for example,
among the shepherds of Mænalia and Parrhasia:
these, as late as the founding of Megalopolis,
lived in villages, amongst which particular boroughs
(as Basilis) were distinguished as the abodes of sovereign
families; such a state was altogether suited to
the interests of the aristocracy or oligarchy. In oligarchical
states, as in Elis, the people in later times
remained almost constantly in the country; and it
frequently happened that grandfathers and grandchildren
had never seen the town: there were also country
courts of justice, and other regulations, intended to
make up for the advantages of a city life.<a id="noteref_291" name="noteref_291" href="#note_291"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">291</span></span></a> But even
in the democratic states, as at Athens, there was
among the people a constant struggle of feeling between
the turbulent working of the democracy, and
the peaceful inclination to their ancient country life.

1. Having considered the subject classes in the
several Doric states, we come to the free citizens properly
so called, who, according to an old Grecian
principle,<a id="noteref_292" name="noteref_292" href="#note_292"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">292</span></span></a> which was actually put in practice in

themselves with the necessaries of life. The
exact distinction between these ranks, and the advantageous
position of the latter class, increased the value
of the rights of citizenship; hence Sparta showed peculiar
reluctance to admitting foreigners to share in them.<a id="noteref_293" name="noteref_293" href="#note_293"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">293</span></span></a>
Before, then, we consider the body politic of free
citizens in its active dealings, it will be proper first to
direct our attention to its component members, to its
division into smaller societies, such as tribes, phratriæ,
houses, &amp;c.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In every Doric state there were three tribes, Hylleis,
Dymanes (or Dymanatæ), and Pamphyli. This
threefold division belonged so peculiarly to the nation
that even Homer called it <span class="tei tei-q">“the thrice-divided”</span>
τριχάϊκες, which ancient epithet is correctly explained
in a verse of Hesiod, as implying the division
of the territory among the people.<a id="noteref_294" name="noteref_294" href="#note_294"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">294</span></span></a> Hence in the
ancient fable which this poet has expressed in an epic
poem, three sons of the ancient Doric king Ægimius
were mentioned, namely, Dyman, Pamphylus, and the
adopted Hyllus; and the same is confirmed by the
direct testimony of Herodotus, who states that the
Doric nation was divided into these three tribes.<a id="noteref_295" name="noteref_295" href="#note_295"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">295</span></span></a>
Hence also Pindar comprehends the whole Doric
nation under the name of the sons of Ægimius and
Hyllus.<a id="noteref_296" name="noteref_296" href="#note_296"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">296</span></span></a> Thus we should be warranted in putting
forth the proposition stated above in these general
terms, even if in the several Doric states there had
been no particular mention of all these tribes. The
fact, however, is, that there are sufficient accounts of
them. Pindar<a id="noteref_297" name="noteref_297" href="#note_297"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">297</span></span></a> bears testimony to their existence in
Sparta; and from an expression of a grammarian, it
may be conjectured that they were also divisions of the
city.<a id="noteref_298" name="noteref_298" href="#note_298"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">298</span></span></a> Herodotus states that these tribes existed at
Sicyon and Argos.<a id="noteref_299" name="noteref_299" href="#note_299"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">299</span></span></a> In Argos, the city was doubtless
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page077">[pg 077]</span><a name="Pg077" id="Pg077" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
divided according to them; and Παμφυλιακὸν is mentioned
as a district of the town.<a id="noteref_300" name="noteref_300" href="#note_300"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">300</span></span></a> The Doric tribes
were transmitted from Argos to Epidaurus and
Ægina.<a id="noteref_301" name="noteref_301" href="#note_301"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">301</span></span></a> Hylleis occur also in the Æginetan colony
of Cydonia.<a id="noteref_302" name="noteref_302" href="#note_302"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">302</span></span></a> The same name is found in an inscription
of Corcyra:<a id="noteref_303" name="noteref_303" href="#note_303"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">303</span></span></a> consequently they also existed in
the mother-country, Corinth. It occurs likewise in
another inscription of Agrigentum;<a id="noteref_304" name="noteref_304" href="#note_304"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">304</span></span></a> they must
therefore have also been in existence at Rhodes, as
indeed is declared by Homer.<a id="noteref_305" name="noteref_305" href="#note_305"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">305</span></span></a> The Pamphylians
occur at Megara as late as at the time of Hadrian.<a id="noteref_306" name="noteref_306" href="#note_306"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">306</span></span></a>
These tribes existed also at Trœzen;<a id="noteref_307" name="noteref_307" href="#note_307"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">307</span></span></a>
but the Trœzenian colony Halicarnassus seems to have been almost
exclusively founded by Dymanes.<a id="noteref_308" name="noteref_308" href="#note_308"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">308</span></span></a> On the whole
it appears that wherever there were Dorians there were
also Hylleans, Pamphylians, and Dymanes.

<a name="Book_III_Chapter_V_Section_2" id="Book_III_Chapter_V_Section_2" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
2. Wherever the Dorians alone had the full rights of
citizenship, no other tribes of the highest ranks could
exist; but if other persons were admitted in any considerable
number to a share in the government, there
were necessarily either one or more tribes in addition
to these three. Thus a fourth, named Hyrnathia,<a id="noteref_309" name="noteref_309" href="#note_309"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">309</span></span></a> is
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page078">[pg 078]</span><a name="Pg078" id="Pg078" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
known to us in the states of Argos and Epidaurus;
in Ægina also an additional tribe of this kind must
have existed, for in this island there were distinguished
families not of Doric origin.<a id="noteref_310" name="noteref_310" href="#note_310"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">310</span></span></a> In Sicyon the fourth
tribe was called the Ægialean. In Corinth also it
appears that there were altogether eight tribes.<a id="noteref_311" name="noteref_311" href="#note_311"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">311</span></span></a> But
in Sparta, the city of pure Doric customs, we cannot
suppose the existence of any other than the three
genuine Doric tribes. At first sight, indeed, it might
appear that the great and distinguished house of the
Ægidæ, of Cadmean descent, was without the pale of
these tribes; but it must have been adopted into one of
the three at its admission to the rights of citizenship.<a id="noteref_312" name="noteref_312" href="#note_312"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">312</span></span></a>
For the number of the Spartan obæ, the gerontes, the
knights, the landed estates, viz., 30, 300, 9000, &amp;c.,
manifestly allow of division by the number 3, while
they have no reference to the number 4.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<a name="Book_III_Chapter_V_Section_3" id="Book_III_Chapter_V_Section_3" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
3. The tribes of Sparta were again divided into
obæ, which are also called phratriæ.<a id="noteref_313" name="noteref_313" href="#note_313"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">313</span></span></a> The term
<span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">phratria</span></span> (φρατριὰ) signified among the Greeks
an union of houses, whether founded upon the ties of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page079">[pg 079]</span><a name="Pg079" id="Pg079" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
actual relationship, or formed for political purposes,
and according to some fixed rule, for the convenience
of public regulations. Thus the word <span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">oba</span></span>
comprehends houses (γένη, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">gentes</span></span>), which were either
really founded on descent from the same stock, or had united themselves
in ancient times for civil and religious purposes,
and afterwards continued to exist as political bodies
under certain regulations.<a id="noteref_314" name="noteref_314" href="#note_314"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">314</span></span></a> The Spartan obæ appear
to have likewise been local divisions, since the name
ὠβὰ, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, οἴα, signifies <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">single</span></em> hamlets or districts
of a town; although in the case of Sparta it is not evident
what relation they bore to the five divisions of the city,
of which we have spoken above.<a id="noteref_315" name="noteref_315" href="#note_315"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">315</span></span></a> It should be, moreover,
observed, that this does not prevent us from supposing
that, as in the parallel case of the phratriæ, the
obæ contained the houses; since we may be allowed to
infer with great probability, from the simple and coherent
regularity of the Spartan institutions, that the
tribes had taken possession of particular districts of
the town, and that these were again divided into smaller
partitions, according to the obæ; a conjecture which,
perhaps, will be confirmed by the statement, that a
place in Sparta was called Agiadæ:<a id="noteref_316" name="noteref_316" href="#note_316"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">316</span></span></a> now this was the
name of one of the royal families, which, as being an
oba, appears to have given its name to one district of
the town.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page080">[pg 080]</span><a name="Pg080" id="Pg080" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The obæ were thirty in number;<a id="noteref_317" name="noteref_317" href="#note_317"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">317</span></span></a> that is, there were
ten of the Hyllean, ten of the Dymanatan, ten of the
Pamphylian tribe. Of the Hyllean, two must have
belonged to the royal families of the Heraclidæ. For
since the councillors, together with the kings, amounted
to thirty, and as this number doubtless depended
upon and proceeded from that of the obæ, it follows
that the two royal families, although springing from
one stock, must nevertheless have been separated into
two different obæ, of which they were in a manner
the representatives. And if we proceed to conclude
in this manner, we shall be obliged, since there were
Heraclidæ, exclusive of the kings, in the
gerusia,<a id="noteref_318" name="noteref_318" href="#note_318"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">318</span></span></a> to
suppose that there were, besides these, other Heraclide
obæ in Sparta; although I am not of opinion
that all the Hyllean houses derived themselves from
Hercules, and were considered as Heraclidæ.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<a name="Book_III_Chapter_V_Section_4" id="Book_III_Chapter_V_Section_4" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
4. With respect to the influence and importance
of the obæ in a political view, it was equal to, or even
greater than, that of the phratriæ in ancient Athens.
For, in the first place, the assembly of the people, in
obedience to a rhetra of Lycurgus, was held according
to tribes and obæ; afterwards the high
council was constituted, and probably the 300 knights
were chosen, upon the same principle. At the same
time, all public situations and offices were not filled
in this manner, but only where distinguished dignity
and honour were required: this mode of election, as
will be shown below, had always an aristocratic tendency.
Magistrates, on the contrary, of a more
democratical character, particularly the ephors, were
nominated without regard to the division of tribes, as
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page081">[pg 081]</span><a name="Pg081" id="Pg081" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
their number alone shows: it is probable that this had
some relation to the number of the divisions of the
city, of which, as was shown above, there were five. A
striking analogy, with regard to this numerary regulation,
is afforded by Athens, while yet under an
aristocratic government. The tribe of the nobles
and knights was in this state divided into three phratriæ,
which may be compared with the three tribes of
the Doric Spartans. Now, when the nobility (like
a chamber of peers) constituted a court of justice
over the Alcmæonidæ, 300 eupatridæse, 100 out of
each phratria, composed the court.<a id="noteref_319" name="noteref_319" href="#note_319"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">319</span></span></a> And when
Cleisthenes the Alcmæonid had been expelled by the
aristocratic party, and the democratic senate (βουλὴ)
overthrown, Isagoras established a high council of
300.<a id="noteref_320" name="noteref_320" href="#note_320"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">320</span></span></a> Whereas the senate, to which Cleisthenes
gave existence and stability, consisted of 500 citizens,
and was chosen, without any regard to the ancient
division into phratriæ, according to the new local
tribes.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
5. No Doric state, with the exception of Sparta,
appears to have given the name of oba to a division of
the people. But neither can the name <span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">phratria</span></span>,
so common in other places, be proved to have been used
by any Doric people. On the other hand, phratriæ
occur at Athens, in the Asiatic colonies,<a id="noteref_321" name="noteref_321" href="#note_321"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">321</span></span></a> and in the
Chalcidean colony of Neapolis, that is, chiefly in
Ionic states; and Neapolis affords a solitary instance of
their being distinguished by certain proper names, such
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page082">[pg 082]</span><a name="Pg082" id="Pg082" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
as Eumelidæ, Eunostidæ, Cymæans, Aristæans, &amp;c.<a id="noteref_322" name="noteref_322" href="#note_322"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">322</span></span></a>
Pindar however mentions <span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">patræ</span></span> (πάτραι) in the
Doric states of Corinth and Ægina; an expression which,
according to the precise definition of Dicæarchus, is
equivalent to houses or γένη, signifying persons descended
from the same ancestor (πατήρ). It was
indeed, although not at Athens, in use among the
Ionians of Asia Minor and the islands, who appear
however to have also employed the terms πάτρα or
πατρία for the more extensive word phratria.<a id="noteref_323" name="noteref_323" href="#note_323"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">323</span></span></a> In
Ægina and Corinth it will be safest to consider the
patræ as houses, since they are always denoted by
patronymic names, going back to fabulous progenitors;
and by Pindar himself they are also called
<span class="tei tei-q">“houses.”</span> Since however, as being not only a
natural, but also a political division, the patræ may
sometimes have comprised <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">several</span></em> houses, and as there
was probably in these states no intermediate division
(like the phratria at Athens and the oba at Sparta)
between them and the tribes, the ancient commentators
have neglected their more restricted and original
sense, and have compared and identified them with
phratriæ.<a id="noteref_324" name="noteref_324" href="#note_324"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">324</span></span></a>

<a name="Book_III_Chapter_V_Section_6" id="Book_III_Chapter_V_Section_6" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
6. The name which the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">houses</span></em> or γένεα bore at
Sparta, and the number of them which was contained
in an oba, may be perhaps ascertained from a passage
of Herodotus,<a id="noteref_325" name="noteref_325" href="#note_325"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">325</span></span></a> in which he mentions the Enomoties,
Triacades, and Syssitia, as military institutions established
by Lycurgus. Other inferences from this
passage we shall not anticipate, remarking only that
the Syssitia appear to have answered to the obæ, from
which it is probable that the Triacades were contained
in these latter divisions. Now in Attica, at an early
period, a triacas was the thirtieth part of a phratria,
and contained thirty men, the same number as a γένος.<a id="noteref_326" name="noteref_326" href="#note_326"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">326</span></span></a>
Following then the argument from analogy (by which
we are so often surprised and guided in our inquiries
into the early political institutions), triacas was in
Sparta also the name of a house, which was so called,
either as being the thirtieth part of an oba, or, as
appears to me more probable, because it contained
thirty houses. The relation of the triacas to the
enomoty,—a small division of warriors, which originally
contained twenty-four men,—is quite uncertain. The
basis of the whole calculation, and in this case a sufficiently
fixed standard, was found in Sparta in the
families (οἶκοι) connected with the landed estates;
indifferently whether these contained several citizens,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page084">[pg 084]</span><a name="Pg084" id="Pg084" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
or whether they had become extinct and been united
with other families.<a id="noteref_327" name="noteref_327" href="#note_327"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">327</span></span></a>

<a name="Book_III_Chapter_V_Section_7" id="Book_III_Chapter_V_Section_7" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
7. We now proceed to mention another division of
the citizens of Sparta, which concerns the difference
of rank. In a certain sense indeed all Dorians were
equal in rights and dignity; but there were yet manifold
gradations, which, when once formed, were retained
by the aristocratic feelings of the people. In
the first place, there was the dignity of the Heraclide
families, which had a precedence throughout the whole
nation;<a id="noteref_328" name="noteref_328" href="#note_328"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">328</span></span></a> and, connected with this, a certain pre-eminence
of the Hyllean tribe; which is also expressed in
Pindar. Then again, in the times of the Peloponnesian
war, <span class="tei tei-q">“men of the first rank”</span> are often mentioned
in Sparta, who, without being magistrates, had
a considerable influence upon the government.<a id="noteref_329" name="noteref_329" href="#note_329"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">329</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Here also the difference between the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Equals</span></em> (ὅμοιοι)
and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Inferiors</span></em> (ὑπομείονες) must be taken into consideration;
which, if we judge only from the terms,
would not appear to have been considerable, yet,
though it is never mentioned in connexion with the
constitution of Lycurgus, it had in later times a certain
degree of influence upon the government. According
to Demosthenes,<a id="noteref_330" name="noteref_330" href="#note_330"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">330</span></span></a> the prize of virtue
in Sparta was to become a master of the state, together with the Equals.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page085">[pg 085]</span><a name="Pg085" id="Pg085" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Whoever neglected a civil duty, lost, according to
Xenophon,<a id="noteref_331" name="noteref_331" href="#note_331"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">331</span></span></a> his rank among the Equals. Cinadon
wished to overthrow the government, because, although
of a powerful and enterprising mind, he did not belong
to the Equals.<a id="noteref_332" name="noteref_332" href="#note_332"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">332</span></span></a> About the king's person in the field
there were always three of the Equals, who provided
for all his wants.<a id="noteref_333" name="noteref_333" href="#note_333"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">333</span></span></a> It also appears that there
were many peculiarities in the education of an Equal.<a id="noteref_334" name="noteref_334" href="#note_334"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">334</span></span></a>
Whoever, during his boyhood and youth, omitted to
make the exertions and endure the fatigues of the
Spartan discipline, lost his rank of an Equal.<a id="noteref_335" name="noteref_335" href="#note_335"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">335</span></span></a> In
like manner, exclusion from the public tables was
followed by a sort of <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">diminutio capitis</span></span>, or
civil degradation.<a id="noteref_336" name="noteref_336" href="#note_336"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">336</span></span></a>
This exclusion was either adjudged by the
other members of the table, or it was the consequence
of inability to defray the due share of the common
expense. To them the Inferiors are most naturally
opposed; and if the latter were distinct from the
Spartans, by the Spartans, in a more limited sense of
the word, Equals are sometimes probably understood.<a id="noteref_337" name="noteref_337" href="#note_337"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">337</span></span></a>
From these scanty accounts the unprejudiced reader
can only infer that a distinction of rank is implied,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page086">[pg 086]</span><a name="Pg086" id="Pg086" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
which depended not upon any charge or office, but
continued through life, without however excluding the
possibility of passing from one rank into the other, any
Equal being liable to be degraded for improper conduct,
and an Inferior, under certain circumstances,
being enabled to procure promotion by bravery and
submission to the authorities; but if this degradation
did not take place, the rank then remained in the
family, and was transmitted to the children, as otherwise
it could not have had any effect upon education.<a id="noteref_338" name="noteref_338" href="#note_338"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">338</span></span></a>

8. After these preliminary inquiries concerning the
divisions and classes of the citizens, we have now to
examine the manner in which the political power was
distributed and held in Sparta and the other Doric
states.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As the foundation of these inquiries, we may premise
a rhetra of Lycurgus, which, given in the form
of an oracle of the Pythian Apollo,<a id="noteref_339" name="noteref_339" href="#note_339"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">339</span></span></a> contains the

<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Build a temple to Zeus Hellanius and Athene
Hellania; divide the tribes, and institute thirty
obas; appoint a council, with its princes; convene
the assembly between Babyca and Cnacion; propose
this, and then depart; and let there be a right
of decision and power to the people.</span></span>”</span> Here then
there is an unlimited authority given to the people to
approve or to reject what the kings proposed. This
full power was, however, more nearly defined and
limited by a subsequent clause, the addition of which
was ascribed to kings Theopompus and Polydorus:
<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">but if the people should follow a crooked opinion,
the elders and the princes shall dissent</span></span>.”</span><a id="noteref_341" name="noteref_341" href="#note_341"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">341</span></span></a> Plutarch
interprets these words thus; <span class="tei tei-q">“That in case the
people does not either approve or reject the measure
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">in toto</span></span>, but alters or vitiates it in any manner, the
kings and councillors should dissolve the assembly,
and declare the decree to be invalid.”</span> According
to this construction, indeed, the public assembly had
so far the supreme power, that nothing could become
a law without its consent. But it probably could not
originate any legislative measure; inasmuch as such
a power would have directly contravened the aristocratical
spirit of the constitution, which feared nothing
so much as the passionate and turbulent haste of the
populace in decreeing and deciding. The sense of
the rhetra of Lycurgus is also given in some verses
from the Eunomia of Tyrtæus, which, on account of
their antiquity and importance, we will quote in their
original language:—

signify a select body, or a committee of the citizens;<a id="noteref_353" name="noteref_353" href="#note_353"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">353</span></span></a>

Our chief object now is to ascertain what were the
subjects which, according to the customs of Sparta,
required the immediate decision of the people. In
the first place, with regard to the external relations of
the state, we know that the whole people alone could
proclaim war, conclude a peace, enter into an armistice
for any length of time, &amp;c.;<a id="noteref_363" name="noteref_363" href="#note_363"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">363</span></span></a> and that all negociations
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page091">[pg 091]</span><a name="Pg091" id="Pg091" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
with foreign states, although conducted by the
kings and ephors, could alone be ratified by the same
authority. With regard to internal affairs, the highest
offices, particularly the councillors, were filled by the
votes of the people;<a id="noteref_364" name="noteref_364" href="#note_364"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">364</span></span></a> a disputed succession to the

in the constitution were proposed and explained, and
all new laws (as often as this rare event took place),
after previous examination in the council, were confirmed
in the assembly.<a id="noteref_366" name="noteref_366" href="#note_366"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">366</span></span></a> Legally also it required the

number of Helots, as being their collective
owner.<a id="noteref_367" name="noteref_367" href="#note_367"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">367</span></span></a> In short, the popular assembly possessed
the supreme legislative authority; but it was so hampered
and restrained by the spirit of the constitution, that it
could only exert its authority within certain prescribed
limits.

10. This circumstance was shown in an especial
manner in the method of its proceedings. None but
public magistrates, chiefly the ephors and kings, together
with the sons of the latter,<a id="noteref_368" name="noteref_368" href="#note_368"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">368</span></span></a> addressed the

that citizens ever came forward upon their own impulse
to speak on public affairs, is neither probable,
nor do any examples of such a practice occur. A
privilege of this kind could, according to Spartan
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page092">[pg 092]</span><a name="Pg092" id="Pg092" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

As therefore the magistrates alone, (τέλη, ἀρχαὶ) were
the leaders and speakers of the assembly, so we often
find that stated as a decree of the authorities (especially
in foreign affairs),<a id="noteref_372" name="noteref_372" href="#note_372"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">372</span></span></a> which had been discussed

The occasional speeches were short, and spoken extempore;
Lysander first delivered before the people
a prepared speech, which he procured from Cleon of
Halicarnassus.<a id="noteref_374" name="noteref_374" href="#note_374"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">374</span></span></a> The method of voting
by acclamation has indeed something rude and barbarous; but
it has the advantage of expressing not only the number
of approving and negative voices, but also the eagerness
of the voters, accurately enough, according to the
ancient simplicity of manners.

may judge from some imperfect accounts, similar
to the Lacedæmonian. It included all the citizens,

too closely connected with the historical epoch to
allow the collection of the scattered accounts in this
place to form an uniform whole. There were everywhere
popular assemblies, as long as they were not
suppressed by tyrants; nor indeed did every tyrant
suppress them; in every state also they represented
the supreme power and sovereignty of the people;
its will was the only law. That this will, however,
should be properly directed, and that the supreme
decision should not be intrusted to the blind impulse
of an ignorant or excited populace, was the problem
which the founders of the Doric governments undertook
to solve.

1. This result was chiefly brought about by the
aristocratical counterpoise to the popular assembly,
the gerusia, which was never wanting in a genuine
Doric state, the <span class="tei tei-q">“council of elders,”</span> as the name
signifies.<a id="noteref_376" name="noteref_376" href="#note_376"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">376</span></span></a> In this respect it is opposed to the senate
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page094">[pg 094]</span><a name="Pg094" id="Pg094" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

latter name, as being the more general term, is
sometimes used for the council, but never the converse.

character, since the government of Argos had not
then become democratical. The Homeric assembly,
which was of a purely aristocratical form, is called
βουλὴ γερόντων or γερουσία;<a id="noteref_378" name="noteref_378" href="#note_378"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">378</span></span></a> it consisted of the older
men of the ruling families, and decided both public
business and judicial causes conjointly with the kings,
properly so called,<a id="noteref_379" name="noteref_379" href="#note_379"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">379</span></span></a>
frequently, however, in connexion
with an ἀγορά. In this assembly lay, but as yet
undeveloped, the political elements of the Doric
gerusia. At Sparta the name was taken in the
strictest sense, as the national opinion laid the greatest
importance upon age in the management of public
affairs; the young men were appointed for war;<a id="noteref_380" name="noteref_380" href="#note_380"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">380</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page095">[pg 095]</span><a name="Pg095" id="Pg095" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

office of a councillor was, however, according to the
expression both of Aristotle and Demosthenes,<a id="noteref_382" name="noteref_382" href="#note_382"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">382</span></span></a> the

none but men of distinguished families, blameless
lives, and eminent station, could occupy it.<a id="noteref_384" name="noteref_384" href="#note_384"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">384</span></span></a> Being

happen that more than one individual was elected at a
time, and the eyes of the whole state were directed
towards the choice of this one person. Distinguished
men, therefore, bordering upon old age, probably
always from the oba to which the person whose place
was vacated had belonged,<a id="noteref_386" name="noteref_386" href="#note_386"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">386</span></span></a> offered themselves

tribunal of the public voice. Their advanced age enabled the electors to
consider and examine a long public life, and ensured
to the state the greatest prudence and experience
in the elected. To provide against the weakness of
age, which Aristotle considers as a defect attendant
on this mode of election, was unnecessary for a time
and a state whose inhabitants enjoyed the highest
bodily health. The aristocratic tendency of the office
required that the candidates should be nominated by
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page096">[pg 096]</span><a name="Pg096" id="Pg096" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
vote, not by lot, but yet by the whole people;<a id="noteref_388" name="noteref_388" href="#note_388"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">388</span></span></a> and
that they themselves should meet with the good-will
of every person; which was particularly required for
this dignity.

2. When they had passed through this ordeal
they were for ever relieved from all further scrutiny,
and were trusted to their own conscience.<a id="noteref_389" name="noteref_389" href="#note_389"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">389</span></span></a>
They were subject to no responsibility, since it
was thought that the near prospect of death would
give them more moderation,<a id="noteref_390" name="noteref_390" href="#note_390"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">390</span></span></a> than the fear of incurring
at the cessation of their office the displeasure
of the community; to whom in other states
the power of calling the highest officers to account
was intrusted. The spirit of this aristocratic institution
was, that the councillors were morally perfect,
and hence it gave them a complete exemption
from all fear as to the consequences of their actions.
To later politicians it appeared still more dangerous
that the councillors of Sparta acted upon their own
judgment, and not according to written laws; but
only because they did not take into account the power
of custom and of ancient habit (the ἄγραφα νόμιμα,
πάτριοι νόμοι),<a id="noteref_391" name="noteref_391" href="#note_391"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">391</span></span></a> which have an absolute sway, so
long as the internal unity of a people is not separated
and destroyed. Upon unwritten laws, which
were fixed in the hearts of the citizens, and were
there implanted by education, the whole public and
legal transactions of the Spartans depended; and
these were doubtless most correctly delivered through
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page097">[pg 097]</span><a name="Pg097" id="Pg097" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the mouths of the experienced old men, whom the
community had voluntarily selected as its best citizens.
Thousands of written laws always leave open
a door for the entrance of arbitrary decision, if they
have not by their mutual connexion a complete
power of supplying what is deficient; this power
is, however, alone possessed by the law, connate with
the people, which, in the ancient simple times, when
national habits are preserved in perfect purity, is
better maintained by custom fixed under the inspection
of the best men, than by any writing.

To me, therefore, the gerusia appears to be a
splendid monument of early Grecian customs: and,
by its noble openness, simple greatness, and pure
confidence, shows that it was safe to build upon the
moral excellence and paternal wisdom of those who
had experienced a long life, and to whom in this instance
the people intrusted its safety and welfare.

3. The functions of the gerusia were double, it
having at the same time an administrative and a
judicial authority. In the first capacity it debated
with the kings upon all important affairs, preparing
them for the decision of the public assembly, and
passed a decree in its first stage by a majority of
voices,<a id="noteref_392" name="noteref_392" href="#note_392"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">392</span></span></a> the influence of which
was doubtless far greater than at Athens: in the latter capacity it had
the supreme decision in all criminal cases, and could
punish with infamy and death.<a id="noteref_393" name="noteref_393" href="#note_393"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">393</span></span></a>
Since, however, in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page098">[pg 098]</span><a name="Pg098" id="Pg098" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
both these directions the power of the council gradually
came in conflict with that of the ephors, we
must first enter into an investigation concerning these
officers, before it will be possible to speak of the
extent of the functions of the council at different
periods. Another circumstance also, which renders
a separate inquiry into the nature of the ephoralty
requisite, is the inspection which it exercised over
the manners of the citizens,<a id="noteref_394" name="noteref_394" href="#note_394"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">394</span></span></a> in which it manifests a
great similarity with the ancient Athenian court of
the Areopagus. As every old man had the right
of severely censuring the habits of any youth, so
every citizen was a youth in comparison with these
aged fathers of the state. Hence the awe and veneration
with which they were commonly regarded at
Sparta. That, however, to an Athenian orator of
the democratic times, the gerusia should appear
possessed of despotic authority, is not surprising; for
it is so far true, that this institution, if transplanted
to Athens, would necessarily have caused a tyrannical
dominion. In Sparta, however, so little was known
of any despotic measure of the gerontes, that, on the
contrary, the constitution was impaired when their
antagonist office, the ephors, gained the ascendency in
influence and power. The institution of the gerusia
was in fact, in its main features, once established at
Athens, when Lysander nominated the Thirty, who
were to be a legislative body, and at the same time
the supreme court of justice; with how little success
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page099">[pg 099]</span><a name="Pg099" id="Pg099" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
is well known; so true is it, that every institution
can only flourish in the soil in which it is first
planted.<a id="noteref_395" name="noteref_395" href="#note_395"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">395</span></span></a>

4. In early times every Doric state must have had
a gerusia; but <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Crete</span></span> is the only place of whose
council accounts have been preserved, and these represent
it in precisely the same light as that of Sparta.
It was, we are informed, armed with large political
and legislative powers, and laid its decrees in a matured
state before the general assembly, for its approval
or rejection.<a id="noteref_396" name="noteref_396" href="#note_396"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">396</span></span></a> It decided, without

In <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Elis</span></span>, also, whose government resembled that
of Sparta, a gerusia was a very important part of the
constitution. It consisted of ninety members, who
were chosen for their lifetime from oligarchical families;<a id="noteref_401" name="noteref_401" href="#note_401"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">401</span></span></a>
but in other respects the election was the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page100">[pg 100]</span><a name="Pg100" id="Pg100" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
same as at Sparta, and therefore they were chosen
by the whole people. Yet there was also a larger
council of 600,<a id="noteref_402" name="noteref_402" href="#note_402"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">402</span></span></a> which may have been an aristocratical
committee selected from the popular assembly. Thus
much at least is clear, that the power of the people
was very limited; and that, as Aristotle says, there
was one oligarchy within another.<a id="noteref_403" name="noteref_403" href="#note_403"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">403</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
5. To the consideration of the gerusia may be
joined the inquiry concerning the kingly office in
Sparta and other Doric states, as being a cognate
element of the constitution. The Doric royalty was
a continuation of the heroic or Homeric; and neither
in the one nor in the other are we to look for that
despotic power, with which the Greeks were not
acquainted until they had seen it in foreign countries.
In those early times the king, together with his
council, was supreme ruler and judge, but not without
it; he was also chief commander in war, and as such
possessed a large executive authority, as circumstances
required. On the whole, however, his station
with regard to the nobles was that of an equal; and
his office, although for the most part hereditary, could
yet be transferred to another family of the aristocracy.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page101">[pg 101]</span><a name="Pg101" id="Pg101" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
He ruled over the common people either in an arbitrary
manner, as the suitors in Ithaca, or as a mild
father, like Ulysses.<a id="noteref_404" name="noteref_404" href="#note_404"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">404</span></span></a> His office on the whole bore an
analogy to the power of Zeus; and it received a religious
confirmation from the circumstance of his presiding
at and performing the great public sacrifices
with the assistance of soothsayers.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<a name="Book_III_Chapter_VI_Section_6" id="Book_III_Chapter_VI_Section_6" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
6. These are the principal features of the kingly
office at Sparta, where, according to Aristotle, as
well as among the Molossi in Epirus, it acquired
firmness by the limitation of its power; it also derived
an additional strength from the mythical notion
that the conquest of the country had originated from
the royal family.<a id="noteref_405" name="noteref_405" href="#note_405"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">405</span></span></a> The main support of the dignity
of the kings was doubtless the honour paid to the
Heraclidæ, which extended throughout the whole of
Greece, and was the theme of many fables; even the
claim of the Spartans to the command of the allied
Grecian armies was in part founded upon it. These
princes, deriving their origin from the first of the heroes
of Greece, were in many respects themselves considered
as heroes,<a id="noteref_406" name="noteref_406" href="#note_406"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">406</span></span></a> and enjoyed a certain religious respect.
Hence also we may account for their funeral ceremonies,
so splendid, when compared with the simplicity
of Doric customs; for the general mourning of
ten days,<a id="noteref_407" name="noteref_407" href="#note_407"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">407</span></span></a> to which a fixed number of Spartans,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page102">[pg 102]</span><a name="Pg102" id="Pg102" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Periœci and Helots came, together with their wives,
from all parts of the country into the city, where they
covered their heads with dust or ashes with great
lamentation, and on each occasion praised the dead
king as the best of all princes;<a id="noteref_408" name="noteref_408" href="#note_408"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">408</span></span></a> as well as for the
exposure of those kings who had fallen in battle,
whose images were laid upon a state-couch:<a id="noteref_409" name="noteref_409" href="#note_409"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">409</span></span></a> usages
which approximate very closely to the worship of an
hero (τιμαὶ ἡρωϊκαί). The royal dignity was also
guarded by the sanction of the sacerdotal office: for
the kings were priests of Zeus Uranius and Zeus Lacedæmon,
and offered public sacrifices to Apollo on
every new moon and seventh day (Νεομήνιος and
Ἑβδομαγέτας);<a id="noteref_410" name="noteref_410" href="#note_410"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">410</span></span></a> they also received the skins of all
sacrificed animals as a part of their income. From
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page103">[pg 103]</span><a name="Pg103" id="Pg103" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
this circumstance, added to the fact that in war they
had a right to the back of every victim, and had liberty
to sacrifice as much as they wished,<a id="noteref_411" name="noteref_411" href="#note_411"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">411</span></span></a> it follows
that they presided over the entire worship of the army,
being both priests and princes, like the Agamemnon
of Homer.<a id="noteref_412" name="noteref_412" href="#note_412"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">412</span></span></a> Their power, however, most directly
required that they should maintain a constant intercourse
between the state and the Delphian oracle;
hence they nominated the Pythians, and, together with
these officers, read and preserved the oracles.<a id="noteref_413" name="noteref_413" href="#note_413"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">413</span></span></a> As
then it appears from these facts that the dignity of the
kings was founded on a religious notion, so it was also
limited by religion; although the account we have is
rather of an ancient custom, which was retained when
its meaning had been lost, than an institution of real
influence. Once in every eight years (δι᾽ ἐτῶν ἐννέα)
the ephors chose a calm and moonless night, and
placed themselves in the most profound silence to
observe the heavens: if there was any appearance of
a shooting star, it was believed that the kings had in
some manner offended the Deity, and they were suspended
until an oracle from Delphi, or the priests at
Olympia, absolved them from the guilt.<a id="noteref_414" name="noteref_414" href="#note_414"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">414</span></span></a> If this
custom (doubtless of great antiquity) is compared
with the frequent occurrence of this period of nine
years in early times, and especially with the tradition
preserved in a verse of Homer, <span class="tei tei-q">“of Minos, who reigned
for periods of nine years, holding intercourse with
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page104">[pg 104]</span><a name="Pg104" id="Pg104" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Zeus,”</span><a id="noteref_415" name="noteref_415" href="#note_415"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">415</span></span></a> it is easy to perceive that the dominion of the
ancient Doric princes determined, as it were, at the
period of every eight years, and required a fresh religious
ratification. So intimate in early times was
the connexion between civil government and religion.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is clear, from what has been said, that the Dorians
considered the kingly office as proceeding from
the Deity, and not as originating from the people;
which would, I believe, have seemed to them in no-wise
more natural, than that the liberty of the people
should be dependent on the king. But they were well
aware that the elements of the constitution had not
been formed by a people consisting, like the American
colonists after their defection from the mother-country,
of individuals possessed of equal rights: but
they had existed at the beginning, and grown with the
growth of the nation. For this reason the people were
not empowered to nominate the king (from which
disputes concerning the rightful succession to the
throne should be carefully distinguished;)<a id="noteref_416" name="noteref_416" href="#note_416"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">416</span></span></a> but the
royal dignity passed in a regular succession to the
eldest son, with this exception, that the sons born
during the reign of the father had the precedence of
their elder brothers: if the eldest son died, the throne
passed to his next male descendant; and on failure of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page105">[pg 105]</span><a name="Pg105" id="Pg105" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
his line, to the younger brothers in succession; if
there was no male issue of the king, the office went to
his brother<a id="noteref_417" name="noteref_417" href="#note_417"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">417</span></span></a> (who also, during the minority of the son
of the late king, was his natural guardian),<a id="noteref_418" name="noteref_418" href="#note_418"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">418</span></span></a> and his
heirs; or, lastly, if the whole line was extinct, to
the next of kin.<a id="noteref_419" name="noteref_419" href="#note_419"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">419</span></span></a> The anxiety of the Spartans for
the legitimacy of their kings, also serves to prove
the high importance which was attached to the genuineness
of their birth. Notwithstanding these
large privileges, the people believed its liberty to be
secured by the oath which was taken every month
by the kings, that they would reign according to the
laws; a custom also in force among the Molossi;<a id="noteref_420" name="noteref_420" href="#note_420"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">420</span></span></a> in return for which, the state engaged through the ephors
to preserve the dominion of the kings unshaken (ἀστυφέλικτος),
if they adhered to their oath.<a id="noteref_421" name="noteref_421" href="#note_421"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">421</span></span></a>

7. The constitutional powers of the kings of Sparta
were inconsiderable, as compared with their dignity
and honours. In the first place, the two kings were
members of the gerusia, and their presence was requisite
to make a full council; but as such they only had
single votes,<a id="noteref_422" name="noteref_422" href="#note_422"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">422</span></span></a> which in their absence were held by the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page106">[pg 106]</span><a name="Pg106" id="Pg106" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
councillor who was most nearly related to them, and
therefore a Heraclide.<a id="noteref_423" name="noteref_423" href="#note_423"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">423</span></span></a> If they were present,
they presided at the council, and accordingly, in the ancient
rhetra above mentioned, they are styled <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">princes</span></em>
(ἀρχαγέται) in reference to the council; it was also
their especial office to speak and to propose measures
in the public assembly. When the council sat as a
court of justice, the kings of course presided in it;
besides which, they had a distinct tribunal of their
own,<a id="noteref_424" name="noteref_424" href="#note_424"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">424</span></span></a> for in Sparta all magistrates had a jurisdiction
in cases which belonged to the branch of the administration
with which they were intrusted: the only
remnant of which custom, spared by the democracy at
Athens, was, that the public officers always <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">introduced</span></em>
such suits into the courts. This coincidence of
administrative and judicial authority also existed at
Sparta in the person of their kings. They held a
court in cases concerning the repair and security of
the public roads, probably in their capacity of generals,
and as superintendents of the intercourse with foreign
nations. It is remarkable that they gave judgment
in all cases of heiresses, and that all adoptions
were made in their presence.<a id="noteref_425" name="noteref_425" href="#note_425"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">425</span></span></a> Both these duties
regarded the maintenance of families, the basis of the
ancient Greek states, the care for which was therefore
intrusted to the kings. Thus in Athens also, the same
duty had been transferred from the ancient kings to
the archon eponymus, who accordingly had the superintendence,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page107">[pg 107]</span><a name="Pg107" id="Pg107" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and a species of guardianship over all
heiresses and orphans.<a id="noteref_426" name="noteref_426" href="#note_426"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">426</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
8. The greater part of the king's prerogative was
his power in foreign affairs. The kings of Sparta
were the commanders of the Peloponnesian confederacy.
They also went out as ambassadors; although
at times of mistrust companions were assigned, who
were known to be disinclined and hostile to them.<a id="noteref_427" name="noteref_427" href="#note_427"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">427</span></span></a>
By the same power the kings also nominated citizens
as proxeni, who entertained ambassadors and citizens
of foreign states in their houses,<a id="noteref_428" name="noteref_428" href="#note_428"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">428</span></span></a> and otherwise provided
for them; it appears that the kings themselves
were in fact the proxeni for foreign countries, and that
those persons whom they nominated are only to be
considered as their deputies.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As soon as the king had assumed the command of
the army, and had crossed the boundaries, he became,
according to ancient custom, general with unlimited
power (στρατηγὸς αὐτοκράτωρ).<a id="noteref_429" name="noteref_429" href="#note_429"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">429</span></span></a> He had authority
to despatch and assemble armies, to collect money in
foreign countries, and to lead and encamp the army
according to his own judgment. Any person who
dared to impede him, or to resist his authority, was
outlawed.<a id="noteref_430" name="noteref_430" href="#note_430"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">430</span></span></a> He had power of life and death, and could
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page108">[pg 108]</span><a name="Pg108" id="Pg108" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
execute without trial (ἐν χειρὸς νόμῳ); although, from
the well-known subordination of the Spartans, such
cases were probably of rare occurrence. But it is
manifest that the king, upon his return, was always
responsible and liable to punishment, as well for an
imprudent, as for a tyrannical use of his powers. His
political was separated with sufficient accuracy from
his military authority, and the king was not permitted
to conclude treaties, or to decide the fate of cities,
without communication with and permission from the
state.<a id="noteref_431" name="noteref_431" href="#note_431"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">431</span></span></a> His military power was, however, thought
dangerous and excessive, and was from time to time
curtailed. This limitation was not indeed effected
by the arrangement which originated from the dissension
between Demaratus and Cleomenes, viz., that
only one king should be with the army at the same
time<a id="noteref_432" name="noteref_432" href="#note_432"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">432</span></span></a> (for this regulation rather increased the power
of the one king who was sent out); but chiefly by the
law, that the king should not go into the field without
ten councillors (a rule which owed its origin to the
over-hasty armistice of Agis),<a id="noteref_433" name="noteref_433" href="#note_433"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">433</span></span></a> and by the compulsory
attendance of the ephors.<a id="noteref_434" name="noteref_434" href="#note_434"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">434</span></span></a>

9. The investigation concerning the revenue of the
kings is not in itself so important as it is rendered
interesting by the parallel with the same office in the
Homeric age. In Homer the kings are represented
as having three sorts of revenues; first, the produce of
their lands (τεμένη),<a id="noteref_435" name="noteref_435" href="#note_435"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">435</span></span></a> which often contained tillage
ground, pastures, and plantations; secondly, the fees
for judicial decisions (δῶρα); and, thirdly, the public
banquets, which were provided at the expense of the
community.<a id="noteref_436" name="noteref_436" href="#note_436"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">436</span></span></a> To these were added
extraordinary gifts, shares of the booty, and other honorary presents.
The case was nearly the same at Sparta, except that
they received no fees for judicial decisions. But in
the first place, the king in this country had his landed
property, which was situated in the territory of several
cities belonging to the Periœci,<a id="noteref_437" name="noteref_437" href="#note_437"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">437</span></span></a> and the
royal tribute (βασιλικὸς φόρος) was probably derived from the same
source.<a id="noteref_438" name="noteref_438" href="#note_438"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">438</span></span></a> This was the foundation of the private wealth
of the kings, which frequently amounted to a considerable
sum; otherwise, how could it have been proposed
to fine king Agis a hundred thousand drachmas,<a id="noteref_439" name="noteref_439" href="#note_439"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">439</span></span></a>
that is, doubtless, Æginetan drachmas, and therefore
about 5800<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">l.</span></span> of our money? Also the younger Agis,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page110">[pg 110]</span><a name="Pg110" id="Pg110" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the son of Eudamidas, was possessed of six hundred
talents in coin;<a id="noteref_440" name="noteref_440" href="#note_440"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">440</span></span></a> and in a dialogue attributed
to Plato, the king of Sparta is declared to be richer than any
private individual at Athens.<a id="noteref_441" name="noteref_441" href="#note_441"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">441</span></span></a> But besides
these revenues, the king received a large sum from the public
property; a double portion at the public banquets,<a id="noteref_442" name="noteref_442" href="#note_442"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">442</span></span></a>
an animal without blemish for sacrifice, a medimnus of
wheat, and a Lacedæmonian quart of wine on the first
and seventh days of each month;<a id="noteref_443" name="noteref_443" href="#note_443"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">443</span></span></a> the share in the
sacrifices above mentioned, &amp;c. It was, moreover,
customary for private individuals who gave entertainments,
to invite the kings, as was the practice in
the Homeric times;<a id="noteref_444" name="noteref_444" href="#note_444"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">444</span></span></a> on these occasions a double portion
was set before them, and when a public sacrifice
took place, the kings had the same rights and preferences.<a id="noteref_445" name="noteref_445" href="#note_445"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">445</span></span></a>
In war, also, the king received a large portion
of the plunder; thus the share of Pausanias, after the
battle of Platæa, was ten women, horses, camels, and
talents:<a id="noteref_446" name="noteref_446" href="#note_446"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">446</span></span></a> in later times it appears that a third
of the booty fell to the lot of the king.<a id="noteref_447" name="noteref_447" href="#note_447"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">447</span></span></a> Lastly, it is proper
to mention the official residence of the two kings of
Sparta, built, according to tradition, by Aristodemus
the ancestor of the two royal families.<a id="noteref_448" name="noteref_448" href="#note_448"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">448</span></span></a> In addition
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page111">[pg 111]</span><a name="Pg111" id="Pg111" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to this dwelling, they had frequently private houses of
their own,<a id="noteref_449" name="noteref_449" href="#note_449"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">449</span></span></a> and a tent was always built for them without
the city, at the public expense.<a id="noteref_450" name="noteref_450" href="#note_450"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">450</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In taking a review of all these statements, it appears
to me that the political sagacity was almost past belief,
with which the ancient constitution of Sparta protected
the power, the dignity, and welfare of the office of
king, yet without suffering it to grow into a despotism,
or without placing the king in any one point either
above or without the law. Without endangering the
liberty of the state, a royal race was maintained, which,
blending the pride of their own family with the national
feelings, produced, for a long succession of years,
princes of a noble and patriotic disposition. Thus it
was in fact with the two Heraclide families, to which
Theopompus, Leonidas, Archidamus II., Agesilaus,
Cleomenes III., and Agis III. belonged; and the
greater number of the later kings retained, up to the
last period, a genuine Spartan disposition, which we
find expressed in many nervous and pithy apophthegms.

10. It may be inferred that it was the case in all,
as we know it to have been in many Dorian states,
with the exception of later colonies, that they were
governed by princes of the Heraclide family. In
Argos, the descendants of Temenus reigned until after
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page112">[pg 112]</span><a name="Pg112" id="Pg112" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

the Æpytidæ ruled as kings until the subjugation of

1. Before we treat of the powers of the cosmi,
it will be necessary to inquire into an office, which
is of the greatest importance in the history of the
Lacedæmonian constitution; for while the king, the
council, and the people, preserved upon the whole
the same political power and the same executive
authority, the office of the ephors was the moving
principle by which, in process of time, this most perfect
constitution was assailed, and gradually overthrown.
From this remark three questions arise:
first, what was the original nature of the office of
ephor? secondly, what changes did it experience in
the lapse of time? and, thirdly, from what causes
did these changes originate?
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page115">[pg 115]</span><a name="Pg115" id="Pg115" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There is an account frequently repeated by ancient
writers, that Theopompus, the grandson of Charilaus
the Proclid, founded this office in order to limit the
authority of the Kings. <span class="tei tei-q">“He handed down the royal
power to his descendants more durable, because he
had diminished it.”</span><a id="noteref_463" name="noteref_463" href="#note_463"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">463</span></span></a> If, however, the ephoralty
was an institution of Theopompus, it is difficult to
account for the existence of the same office in other
Doric states. In Cyrene the ephors punished litigious
people and impostors with infamy:<a id="noteref_464" name="noteref_464" href="#note_464"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">464</span></span></a> the same
office existed in the mother-city Thera,<a id="noteref_465" name="noteref_465" href="#note_465"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">465</span></span></a> which island
had been colonised from Laconia long before the time
of Theopompus. The Messenians also would hardly,
upon the re-establishment of their state, have received
the ephoralty into their government,<a id="noteref_466" name="noteref_466" href="#note_466"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">466</span></span></a> if they
had thought it only an institution of some Spartan
king. The ephors of the Tarentine colony Heraclea
may be more easily derived from Sparta and the
time of Theopompus.<a id="noteref_467" name="noteref_467" href="#note_467"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">467</span></span></a> It is however plain that
Herodotus<a id="noteref_468" name="noteref_468" href="#note_468"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">468</span></span></a> and Xenophon<a id="noteref_469" name="noteref_469" href="#note_469"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">469</span></span></a> placed the ephoralty
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page116">[pg 116]</span><a name="Pg116" id="Pg116" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
among the institutions of Lycurgus, with as much
reason as other writers attributed it to Theopompus;
and it will probably be sufficient to state that the
ephors were ancient Doric magistrates.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The ephoralty, however, considered as an office
opposed to the kings and to the council, is not for
this reason an institution less peculiar to the Spartans;
and in no Doric, nor even in any Grecian state,
is there any thing which exactly corresponds with
it. It is evident, therefore, that it must have gradually
obtained this peculiar character by causes which
operated upon the Lacedæmonian state alone. Hence
it appears, that the supposed expression of Theopompus
referred rather to the powers of the ephors
in later times, than to their original condition. At
least Cleomenes the Third was ignorant of this account
of them; since, after the abolition of these
magistrates, he proposed, in a speech to the people,
that the ephors should again be what they were
originally (when they were elected in the first Messenian
war), viz., the deputies and assistants of the
king. In this proposal indeed a very partial view
is displayed; for every magistrate must necessarily
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page117">[pg 117]</span><a name="Pg117" id="Pg117" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
choose his own deputy; whereas the democratic election
of the ephors was, as we shall presently see, an
essential part of their office. From the accounts
just adduced, we do not however wish to infer any
thing further, than how variable were the opinions,
and how little historical the statements, concerning
the original object of the ephoralty.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. In the constitution of Lycurgus, as it has been
hitherto developed, the ephoralty of later times would
not only have been a superfluous, but a destructive
addition. For in this the king, the council, and the
people constituted the chief authorities; and to suppose
that any part would require either check or
assistance, would have been inconsistent with the
plans of the legislator. A counter-authority, such as
the ephoralty, in which the mistrust of the people
was expressed in a tyrannical manner, was far removed
from the innocence and simplicity of the
original constitution, and could not have been introduced,
until the connexion and firmness arising from
the first laws had been loosened and enfeebled. The
Roman office of tribune had, doubtless, a certain
similarity in its first origin with the ephoralty;<a id="noteref_470" name="noteref_470" href="#note_470"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">470</span></span></a> yet
the former was more imperatively required, as by it
an entire people, the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">plebs Romana</span></span>, obtained a
necessary and fair representation; whereas in Sparta the
gerusia, although chosen from the most distinguished
citizens, belonged nevertheless to the whole Spartan
people, and the democratic influence of the popular
assembly served as the basis of the whole constitution.<a id="noteref_471" name="noteref_471" href="#note_471"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">471</span></span></a>
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page118">[pg 118]</span><a name="Pg118" id="Pg118" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If then the extended political power of the ephors
did not belong to the constitution of Lycurgus, neither
can we suppose that it originated in the time of Theopompus.
For the statement is worthy of credit, that
Theopompus and Polydorus added the following
words to the rhetra above quoted: <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">If however the
people should follow a crooked opinion, the councillors
and princes shall dissent.</span></span>”</span> Now in the
first place, the ephors are here wholly omitted,
although in the Peloponnesian war they put the vote
to the people, and frequently made proposals in the
assembly; and, secondly, the tendency of this clause
is manifestly to diminish the power of the people;
whereas it will be more clearly shown below, that
the authority of the ephors rested upon democratical
principles.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is evident that these supposed historical traditions,
instead of affording any clear explanation, lead
to contradictions; and in order to obtain any distinct
knowledge of the history of the ephoralty, we must
proceed rather upon the evidence furnished by the
nature of the office itself, and the analogy of similar
offices in other states.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<a name="Book_III_Chapter_VII_Section_3" id="Book_III_Chapter_VII_Section_3" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
3. For this reason we will first consider the judicial
authority of the ephors, a power which we know
to have belonged also to the ephors of Cyrene. Now
Aristotle<a id="noteref_472" name="noteref_472" href="#note_472"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">472</span></span></a> describes their judicial powers by saying,
that they decided causes relating to contracts, while
the council decided causes of homicide.<a id="noteref_473" name="noteref_473" href="#note_473"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">473</span></span></a> The latter
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page119">[pg 119]</span><a name="Pg119" id="Pg119" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
was therefore a supreme criminal court, with power
of life and death; the former a civil court, which
gave judgment concerning contracts and property.
Its influence upon the Spartans would appear to have
been inconsiderable, from the opinions entertained by
them on the division of property and exchange of
money, perhaps less than it really was; but however
this may be, the Periœci and Helots, when they were
in Sparta, were under its jurisdiction. Now we
have already shown, that it was a principle of the
Lacedæmonian government so to divide the jurisdiction
amongst the different magistrates, that the
administration and jurisdiction belonged to the same
officers.<a id="noteref_474" name="noteref_474" href="#note_474"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">474</span></span></a> Hence a superintendence over sales and
over the market must have been the original duty
of the ephors, forming the basis of their judicial
authority.<a id="noteref_475" name="noteref_475" href="#note_475"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">475</span></span></a> The market, as being the central point
of exchange, was no unimportant object of care:<a id="noteref_476" name="noteref_476" href="#note_476"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">476</span></span></a> every Spartan here brought a part of the corn produced
by his estate, in order to exchange it for other
commodities: it was in a certain manner disgraceful
not to have the power of buying and selling;<a id="noteref_477" name="noteref_477" href="#note_477"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">477</span></span></a> a
privilege which was also interdicted to youths: moreover,
in the days of mourning for the king, the market was
shut up and scattered with chaff.<a id="noteref_478" name="noteref_478" href="#note_478"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">478</span></span></a>
The day upon
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page120">[pg 120]</span><a name="Pg120" id="Pg120" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
which Cinadon, according to the description of
Xenophon,<a id="noteref_479" name="noteref_479" href="#note_479"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">479</span></span></a> secretly endeavoured to inflame the
minds of the lower classes, was evidently a market-day,
and also, in my opinion, a great day of justice. A
king, the ephors, the councillors, and about forty
Spartans (ὅμοιοι), were in the market-place, all probably
in a judicial capacity: besides whom, there
were about four thousand men, chiefly occupied in
buying and selling, as is seen from the fact that in
one part of the market a large quantity of iron fabrics
was heaped up. The ephors were therefore ἔφοροι
(inspectors) over the market, and for this reason they
met regularly in this place,<a id="noteref_480" name="noteref_480" href="#note_480"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">480</span></span></a> where was also
situated their office.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The number of the college of ephors (five),<a id="noteref_481" name="noteref_481" href="#note_481"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">481</span></span></a> which
it had in common with some other magistrates of
Sparta,<a id="noteref_482" name="noteref_482" href="#note_482"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">482</span></span></a> appears, as I conjectured
above,<a id="noteref_483" name="noteref_483" href="#note_483"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">483</span></span></a> to imply a
democratic election—a fact which is also stated by
the ancients. We know from Aristotle, that persons
from the people, without property or distinction, could
fill this office:<a id="noteref_484" name="noteref_484" href="#note_484"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">484</span></span></a> in what manner, indeed, is not quite
manifest. Properly indeed, no magistrate in Sparta
was chosen by lot;<a id="noteref_485" name="noteref_485" href="#note_485"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">485</span></span></a> but it appears that election by
choice and by lot were combined.<a id="noteref_486" name="noteref_486" href="#note_486"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">486</span></span></a> In this case we
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page121">[pg 121]</span><a name="Pg121" id="Pg121" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
see displayed a principle of the ancient Greek states,
which administered the criminal jurisdiction on aristocratic
principles, while civil causes were decided by
the whole community, or its representatives. At
Athens, Solon gave the popular courts a jurisdiction
only in civil suits; all criminal cases were decided
by the timocratic Areopagus, and the aristocratic
Ephetæ. In Heraclea on the Pontus, the chief
officers were chosen from a small number of the
citizens, the courts of justice from the rest of the
people.<a id="noteref_487" name="noteref_487" href="#note_487"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">487</span></span></a> And in Sparta also the civil
judges were the deputies of the assembly—the ἁλίαια,<a id="noteref_488" name="noteref_488" href="#note_488"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">488</span></span></a> which in
Athens itself acted as a court of justice under the
name of ἡλίαια.

4. From the view of this office now taken, the
continued extension of the powers of the ephors may
be more easily accounted for. It was the regular
course of events in the Grecian states, that the civil
courts enlarged their influence, while the power of
the criminal courts was continually on the decline.
As in Athens, the Helæeea rose, as compared with
the Areopagus, so in Sparta the power of the ephors
increased in comparison with that of the gerusia.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the first place, the jurisdiction of the ephors
was extended<a id="noteref_489" name="noteref_489" href="#note_489"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">489</span></span></a> chiefly by their privilege of instituting
scrutinies (εὔθυναι) into the official conduct of all
magistrates, with the exception of the councillors.<a id="noteref_490" name="noteref_490" href="#note_490"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">490</span></span></a>
By this indeed we are not to understand, that all
magistrates, after the cessation of their office, rendered
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page122">[pg 122]</span><a name="Pg122" id="Pg122" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
an account of their proceedings, but only that
the ephors could compel them to undergo a trial, if
there had been any thing suspicious in their administration;
a right, however, as it extended over the
ephors of the preceding year,<a id="noteref_491" name="noteref_491" href="#note_491"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">491</span></span></a> which restrained the
power that it bestowed. But the ephors were not
compelled to wait for the natural expiration of an
office, they could suspend or deprive the officer by
their judicial powers.<a id="noteref_492" name="noteref_492" href="#note_492"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">492</span></span></a> Now in this respect
the king was in the very same situation with the remaining
magistrates, and could, as well as the others, be
brought before the tribunal of the ephors. Even
before the Persian war, Cleomenes was tried before
them for bribery.<a id="noteref_493" name="noteref_493" href="#note_493"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">493</span></span></a> The king was always bound to
obey their summons:<a id="noteref_494" name="noteref_494" href="#note_494"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">494</span></span></a> but the fact of his not being
compelled to yield till the third time, was used by
Cleomenes III. as an argument to prove that the power of
the ephors was originally an usurpation.<a id="noteref_495" name="noteref_495" href="#note_495"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">495</span></span></a>
At the same time, their power extended in practice so
far, that they could accuse the king, as well as the
other magistrates, in extreme cases, without consulting
the assembly, and could bring him to trial
for life and death.<a id="noteref_496" name="noteref_496" href="#note_496"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">496</span></span></a> This larger court consisted of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page123">[pg 123]</span><a name="Pg123" id="Pg123" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
all the councillors, of the ephors, who thus came
before it as accusers, besides having the right of
sitting as judges, of the other king, and probably of
several magistrates, who had all equal votes.<a id="noteref_497" name="noteref_497" href="#note_497"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">497</span></span></a> From
this court there was no appeal; it had power to
condemn the king to death;<a id="noteref_498" name="noteref_498" href="#note_498"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">498</span></span></a> although, until
later times, it was prevented by a religious scruple from
executing this sentence.<a id="noteref_499" name="noteref_499" href="#note_499"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">499</span></span></a> That its proceedings
were commonly carried on with great propriety and composure,
is stated upon the occasion of an instance
to the contrary.<a id="noteref_500" name="noteref_500" href="#note_500"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">500</span></span></a> This great court of magistrates
we frequently find deciding concerning public crimes
with supreme authority,<a id="noteref_501" name="noteref_501" href="#note_501"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">501</span></span></a> and the ephors acting in it as
accusers:<a id="noteref_502" name="noteref_502" href="#note_502"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">502</span></span></a> but that the ephors had power of themselves
to punish with death, I deny most decidedly:<a id="noteref_503" name="noteref_503" href="#note_503"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">503</span></span></a>

The inaccuracy of later writers has confounded the
steps preparatory to the sentence, with the sentence
itself; a power of life and death in the hands of the
ephors would have been worse than tyranny. The
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page124">[pg 124]</span><a name="Pg124" id="Pg124" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
ephors, when they judged for themselves, were only
able to impose fines, and to compel an instantaneous
payment.<a id="noteref_505" name="noteref_505" href="#note_505"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">505</span></span></a> Their power of punishing the kings in
this manner, or by a reprimand, was doubtless very
extensive, and appears to have been subject to no
limitation. Agesilaus was fined by them for endeavouring
to make himself popular,<a id="noteref_506" name="noteref_506" href="#note_506"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">506</span></span></a> and Archidamus
was censured for having married too small a wife,<a id="noteref_507" name="noteref_507" href="#note_507"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">507</span></span></a>
which implies the opinion, that the community had
a right to require their kings to keep up a robust
family.<a id="noteref_508" name="noteref_508" href="#note_508"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">508</span></span></a> The kings, however, were compelled to
submit to this treatment, in a state in which every
magistrate exercised the full powers of his office with
a certain degree of severity. We find, however,
that the ephors had also jurisdiction in cases which
were neither civil actions nor the scrutinies of public
officers; for example, they punished a man for having
brought money into the state;<a id="noteref_509" name="noteref_509" href="#note_509"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">509</span></span></a>
another for indolence;<a id="noteref_510" name="noteref_510" href="#note_510"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">510</span></span></a>
a third from the singular reason that he was generally
injured and insulted:<a id="noteref_511" name="noteref_511" href="#note_511"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">511</span></span></a> and their share in the superintendence
of public education,<a id="noteref_512" name="noteref_512" href="#note_512"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">512</span></span></a> as well as over the
celebration of the public games,<a id="noteref_513" name="noteref_513" href="#note_513"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">513</span></span></a> gave them a jurisdiction
in causes relating to these points. In cases
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page125">[pg 125]</span><a name="Pg125" id="Pg125" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of this kind, however, we are ignorant how far they
acted as a separate board, and how far in connexion
with other magistrates, for example, as assessors of
the kings.<a id="noteref_514" name="noteref_514" href="#note_514"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">514</span></span></a> They judged according to unwritten laws,
as Sparta knew no others. Aristotle calls this, deciding
according to their will and pleasure.<a id="noteref_515" name="noteref_515" href="#note_515"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">515</span></span></a>

5. Another more important circumstance, as affecting
the extension of the power of the ephors, was, that
these officers (from what time we are not informed)
placed themselves in connexion with the popular assembly,
so that they had a right to transact business
with it in preference to all other magistrates. They
had power to convene the people,<a id="noteref_516" name="noteref_516" href="#note_516"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">516</span></span></a> and put the
vote to them.<a id="noteref_517" name="noteref_517" href="#note_517"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">517</span></span></a> They must in early times have had
the privilege of proposing laws<a id="noteref_518" name="noteref_518" href="#note_518"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">518</span></span></a> (but doubtless not till after
they had passed through the gerusia), if the ephor
Chilon is correctly called a legislator.<a id="noteref_519" name="noteref_519" href="#note_519"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">519</span></span></a>
They also possessed great authority in transactions with foreign
nations. They admitted ambassadors, and had also power to dismiss
them from the boundary,<a id="noteref_520" name="noteref_520" href="#note_520"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">520</span></span></a> likewise
to expel suspected foreigners from the state,<a id="noteref_521" name="noteref_521" href="#note_521"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">521</span></span></a> and
therefore they were probably the chief managers of
the Xenelasia. They frequently carried on the negotiations
with foreign ambassadors, with full powers of
treating;<a id="noteref_522" name="noteref_522" href="#note_522"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">522</span></span></a> and had great influence, especially of a preparatory
nature,<a id="noteref_523" name="noteref_523" href="#note_523"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">523</span></span></a> upon declarations of war, as well as
armistices and treaties of peace,<a id="noteref_524" name="noteref_524" href="#note_524"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">524</span></span></a> which the ephors, and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page126">[pg 126]</span><a name="Pg126" id="Pg126" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
particularly the first among them, swore to and subscribed
in presence of other persons.<a id="noteref_525" name="noteref_525" href="#note_525"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">525</span></span></a> To them also
was intrusted the right of dismissing ambassadors.<a id="noteref_526" name="noteref_526" href="#note_526"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">526</span></span></a>
In time of war they were empowered to send out
troops (φρουρὰν φαίνειν<a id="noteref_527" name="noteref_527" href="#note_527"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">527</span></span></a>) on whatever day seemed to
them expedient;<a id="noteref_528" name="noteref_528" href="#note_528"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">528</span></span></a> and they even appear to have had
authority to determine the number of men.<a id="noteref_529" name="noteref_529" href="#note_529"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">529</span></span></a> The

general,<a id="noteref_530" name="noteref_530" href="#note_530"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">530</span></span></a> who received from them instructions how to
act;<a id="noteref_531" name="noteref_531" href="#note_531"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">531</span></span></a> sent back to the ephors for fresh instructions;<a id="noteref_532" name="noteref_532" href="#note_532"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">532</span></span></a>
were restrained by them through the attendance of
extraordinary plenipotentiaries;<a id="noteref_533" name="noteref_533" href="#note_533"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">533</span></span></a> were recalled by
means of the scytale;<a id="noteref_534" name="noteref_534" href="#note_534"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">534</span></span></a> summoned before a judicial
tribunal;<a id="noteref_535" name="noteref_535" href="#note_535"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">535</span></span></a> and their first duty after their
return was to visit the office of the ephors.<a id="noteref_536" name="noteref_536" href="#note_536"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">536</span></span></a> These officers also sent
commands, with respect to discipline, to standing
armies abroad,<a id="noteref_537" name="noteref_537" href="#note_537"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">537</span></span></a> Now in these cases the ephors must
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page127">[pg 127]</span><a name="Pg127" id="Pg127" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
have acted, not upon their own authority, but as the
agents of the public assembly;<a id="noteref_538" name="noteref_538" href="#note_538"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">538</span></span></a> it was their duty to
execute the decrees of the people, the mode being left
in some degree to their discretion. For this reason
the assembly is frequently mentioned, together with
the ephors, in the same cases in which on other occasions
the ephors alone are represented as acting. The
ephors were often manifestly mediators between the
generals and the assembly. In the field the king was
followed by two ephors, who belonged to the council
of war;<a id="noteref_539" name="noteref_539" href="#note_539"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">539</span></span></a> it is probable that they had the chief care of
the maintenance of the army, as well as the division of
the plunder:<a id="noteref_540" name="noteref_540" href="#note_540"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">540</span></span></a> those ephors who remained behind in
Sparta received the booty in charge, and paid it in to
the public treasury.<a id="noteref_541" name="noteref_541" href="#note_541"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">541</span></span></a> We also find the ephors deciding
with regard to conquered cities, whether they
should be dependent or independent;<a id="noteref_542" name="noteref_542" href="#note_542"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">542</span></span></a> they suppressed
the ten governors appointed by Lysander, nominated
harmosts,<a id="noteref_543" name="noteref_543" href="#note_543"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">543</span></span></a> &amp;c.; all evidently in the
name and authority of that power, which it would have been against all
principles of a free constitution to intrust to the college
of ephors.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
6. Although we are prevented from obtaining an
entirely clear view of this subject, and particularly
from pointing out all the collisions between the authority
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page128">[pg 128]</span><a name="Pg128" id="Pg128" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the ephors and other magistrates, by the
secret nature of the Spartan constitution,<a id="noteref_544" name="noteref_544" href="#note_544"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">544</span></span></a> it is yet
evident that the powers of the ephors were essentially
founded upon the supreme authority of the popular
assembly, whose agents and plenipotentiaries they were.
Every popular assembly is necessarily an unskilful
body, and little able to act both with energy and moderation;
least of all was the Spartan assembly capable
of transacting and executing any complicated business.
For this reason it intrusted to the ephors, who were
chosen upon democratic principles from among the
people, a power similar to that which the public leaders
or demagogues of Athens exercised in so pernicious
a manner. Plato and Aristotle compare their authority
with a tyranny:<a id="noteref_545" name="noteref_545" href="#note_545"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">545</span></span></a> and it is to be remembered that
in Greece tyrants continually rose from demagogues.
Accordingly the ephors reached the summit of their
power when they began to lead the public assembly:
it is probable that this was first done by the ephor
Asteropus, who is one of the first persons to whom
the extension of the powers of that office is ascribed,<a id="noteref_546" name="noteref_546" href="#note_546"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">546</span></span></a> and who probably lived not long before the time of
Chilon. The extensive political influence of Lacedæmon
also contributed to give a greater importance to
the ephoralty. Chasms arose in the constitution of
Lycurgus, which had been intended for a simpler state
of things, and were filled up by the ambition of these
magistrates. The transactions with foreign states required
a small number of skilful and clever men; the
gerusia was too helpless, simple, and antiquated for
this purpose; and accordingly the sphere of its operations
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page129">[pg 129]</span><a name="Pg129" id="Pg129" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
appears to have been confined to domestic affairs.
And lastly, as the finances of Sparta became continually
an object of greater and greater importance,
the influence of the officers necessarily increased, who
had, as it appears, at all times the management of the
treasury.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<a name="Book_III_Chapter_VII_Section_7" id="Book_III_Chapter_VII_Section_7" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
7. There are some other facts which may be added
respecting the official proceedings of the ephors.
They commenced their annual office with the autumnal
equinox, the beginning of the Lacedæmonian year.<a id="noteref_547" name="noteref_547" href="#note_547"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">547</span></span></a>
The first of them gave his name to the year, which was
called after him in all public transactions. They commenced
their official duties with a species of edict, by
which the secret officers (κρυπτοὶ) were sent out: it
appears from this that they also exercised a superintendence
over the discipline of the Helots and Periœci.<a id="noteref_548" name="noteref_548" href="#note_548"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">548</span></span></a>
In the same edict it was ordered <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">to shave the beard</span></span>,”</span>
<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">and obey the laws</span></span>,”</span><a id="noteref_549" name="noteref_549" href="#note_549"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">549</span></span></a> the former being a metaphorical,
and indeed rather a singular expression for subjection
and obedience. They held their daily meetings in the
ephors' office, in which they also ate together.<a id="noteref_550" name="noteref_550" href="#note_550"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">550</span></span></a> In
this house foreigners and ambassadors were introduced,
and hospitably entertained.<a id="noteref_551" name="noteref_551" href="#note_551"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">551</span></span></a> Next to the Ephoreum
stood a temple of Fear, which the dictatorial power of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page130">[pg 130]</span><a name="Pg130" id="Pg130" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
these magistrates doubtless inspired in the citizens.<a id="noteref_552" name="noteref_552" href="#note_552"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">552</span></span></a> Lastly, these officers also required a religious foundation
for their dignity. The ephors at certain periods
saw dreams in the temple of Pasiphaa at Thalamæ,
and their visions were politically interpreted: we know
that a dream of this kind stimulated the Spartans to
return to their ancient equality.<a id="noteref_553" name="noteref_553" href="#note_553"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">553</span></span></a> Of their periodical
inspection of the heavens we have already spoken,
when treating of the kingly office:<a id="noteref_554" name="noteref_554" href="#note_554"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">554</span></span></a> and it is remarkable
that this custom, which was doubtless of great
antiquity, occurs first in very late times, and was used
in support of the tyranny of the ephors over the kings.
It is these later times in particular which confirm the
assertion made in the beginning of the chapter, that
the ephoralty was the moving element, the principle of
change, in the Spartan constitution, and, in the end,
the cause of its final dissolution; for the ephors, being
brought by means of their jurisdiction and their political
duties into extensive intercourse with foreign
nations, were the first to give up the severe customs of
ancient Sparta, and to admit a greater luxury of
manners. Even Aristotle censures their relaxed mode
of life.<a id="noteref_555" name="noteref_555" href="#note_555"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">555</span></span></a> It is still more to our
purpose that the decrees which undermined the constitution of Sparta
originated from these magistrates: it was the ephor
Epitadeus who first carried through the law permitting
the free inheritance of property. For this reason it
was necessary for the royal heroes Agis and Cleomenes,
when, in a fruitless but glorious struggle with
the degenerate age, they undertook to restore the constitution
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page131">[pg 131]</span><a name="Pg131" id="Pg131" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of Lycurgus, to begin with the overthrow of
the ephors.<a id="noteref_556" name="noteref_556" href="#note_556"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">556</span></span></a>

8. The undefined and vague nature of the authority
of the ephors<a id="noteref_557" name="noteref_557" href="#note_557"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">557</span></span></a> is strongly opposed to the accurate
designation of the duties of the other annual officers.
Although there were many officers of this description
at Sparta, we seldom find any mention of them, as they
rarely overstepped the legal bounds of their authority.
Yet it is possible that the name τέλη,<a id="noteref_558" name="noteref_558" href="#note_558"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">558</span></span></a> which is so frequently
used for the presidents of the assembly, and
the high court for state offences, and which to a
foreigner rather concealed than explained the internal
affairs of Sparta, comprehended other magistrates,
according to the circumstances of the case, besides the
kings, councillors, and ephors. The nomophylaces
and bidiæi,<a id="noteref_559" name="noteref_559" href="#note_559"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">559</span></span></a> as well as the ephors, had their
offices in the market-place. The duties of the former officers
are declared by their name, of their number we know
nothing; of the latter there were five, and their business
was to inspect the gymnastic exercises.<a id="noteref_560" name="noteref_560" href="#note_560"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">560</span></span></a> The

The polemarchs also, in addition to their military functions,
had a civil, together with a certain judicial power.
In some Laconian inscriptions, belonging to the
Roman time, many names of nomophylaces, buagi,
and σύσσιτοι of the magistrates are recorded; the
meaning of the latter distinction is obscure. The
election of regular nomophylaces was an occurrence
somewhat unusual.<a id="noteref_563" name="noteref_563" href="#note_563"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">563</span></span></a> With regard to later times we

Roman dominion;<a id="noteref_564" name="noteref_564" href="#note_564"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">564</span></span></a> and that the same king

1. The cosmi of Crete are compared by Aristotle,
Ephorus and Cicero, with the ephors of Lacedæmon.<a id="noteref_568" name="noteref_568" href="#note_568"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">568</span></span></a>
We are first led to suspect the correctness of this
comparison by the fact, that the larger part of the
extensive power of the ephoralty did not exist in the
ancient constitution of Sparta, and consequently there
could not have been any thing corresponding with it
in the sister constitution of Crete. This conjecture
is still further confirmed when we remember that the
cosmi were chosen from particular families, rather
according to their rank than their personal merits.<a id="noteref_569" name="noteref_569" href="#note_569"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">569</span></span></a> For to take away from the office of ephors their
election from among the people would be to give up
its most essential characteristic. If then we abandon
this comparison, it will be necessary, on account of
the great similarity between the two constitutions,
to find some other analogous office, and it will then
appear that the parallel magistrates to the cosmi in
the Spartan government were the kings; whom
indeed the cosmi appear to have succeeded, like the
prytanes, artynæ, &amp;c., in other states, the expiring
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page134">[pg 134]</span><a name="Pg134" id="Pg134" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
monarchical dignity having been replaced by an aristocratical
magistrate.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This assertion is confirmed by whatever knowledge
we have of the powers of the cosmi, which
indeed chiefly regards their influence in foreign
affairs. They were commanders in war, like the
kings of Sparta.<a id="noteref_570" name="noteref_570" href="#note_570"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">570</span></span></a> They conducted the

an occasion of the connexion of two Cretan cities by

The common routine of business they appear to have
conducted with a large executive power;<a id="noteref_578" name="noteref_578" href="#note_578"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">578</span></span></a> they

apparently during the continuance of their

they had more power and more extensive duties than
the Spartan kings; yet both were limited by the large
number of the college of cosmi, for it contained ten
members. The college had power to degrade individuals,
although the office was limited to a year,
each individual being also permitted to tender his
resignation within that period.<a id="noteref_582" name="noteref_582" href="#note_582"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">582</span></span></a> The first

protocosmus,<a id="noteref_583" name="noteref_583" href="#note_583"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">583</span></span></a> although he had probably no distinct privileges.
The senate was chosen from persons who
had filled the office of cosmus; it was not, however,
so arranged that each cosmus, on the cessation of his
office, became a senator (as at Athens, after the time
of Solon, every archon, if no complaint was made
against him, became a member of the Areopagus),
but the senators were selected from among the former
cosmi, after a fresh examination. For the number
of the senators was, doubtless, limited, and was not
sufficiently great to comprehend all the cosmi.

2. In the time of Aristotle the power of the cosmi
had acquired a despotic character. The number of
the families from which they were chosen had become
less numerous; individual families had acquired an
immediate influence upon the government, and their
disputes had created parties, in which the whole
nation took a share. The constitution had been thus
converted into a narrow oligarchy; the democratic
element, the public assembly, being too feeble to
put an end to these dissensions. To this was added,
at a time when men had ceased to venerate ancient
customs, a want of written laws. When powerful
families feared for the issue of a lawsuit, they prevented
the election of the cosmi, and an ἀκοσμία, as it
was called, arose,<a id="noteref_584" name="noteref_584" href="#note_584"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">584</span></span></a> in which the chief families and
their dependents were opposed to one another as
enemies. This state of things had at that time
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page137">[pg 137]</span><a name="Pg137" id="Pg137" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
been introduced in several of the chief cities of
Crete: at the time, however, when the alliance
between the Priansii and Hierapytnii (which is still
extant) was agreed to, the government appears to
have been better regulated, and the powers of the
aristocracy to have been considerably diminished.
But before the time of Polybius a complete revolution
had taken place, by which the power of the
aristocracy was abolished, and the election of all
magistrates founded on democratic principles;<a id="noteref_585" name="noteref_585" href="#note_585"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">585</span></span></a> a
revolution which gradually overthrew all the ancient
institutions; so that the writer just mentioned cannot
discover the least resemblance between the Spartan
and Cretan governments, the original similarity of
which cannot be doubted. It is worthy of remark
that cosmi, as far as we know, were the chief magistrates
in all the cities of Crete; and their constitutions
were in all essential points the same: a proof
that these cities, although originally founded by
different tribes, were in their political institutions
determined by the governing, that is, the Doric
race.<a id="noteref_586" name="noteref_586" href="#note_586"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">586</span></span></a>
In the time of Plato, Cnosus was still, as in the
time of Minos, considered the chief seat of ancient
Cretan institutions; Ephorus, on the other hand,
observes that they had been less preserved in this
town than among the Lyctians, Gortynians, and other
small cities.<a id="noteref_587" name="noteref_587" href="#note_587"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">587</span></span></a>

3. With the Cretan cosmi may be compared the
magistrates named prytanes, who in Corinth, as well
as in other states, succeeded in the place of the
kings. The numerous house of the Bacchiadæ were
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page138">[pg 138]</span><a name="Pg138" id="Pg138" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
not content that certain individuals of their number
should exercise the government as an hereditary right
for life, but wished to obtain a larger share in it, and
to give the enjoyment of the supreme power to a
greater number. The only difference, however, which
existed between a prytanis and a king was, that the
former was elected, and only held his office for a
year, by which he was compelled to administer it
according to the will of his house, into the body of
which he was soon to return. In this state, doubtless,
there was also a gerusia, but perhaps only consisting
of Bacchiadæ. As the Bacchiadæ only intermarried
with persons of their own house, they formed an
aristocratic caste, whose government, which lasted
for ninety years, must have been exceedingly
oppressive.<a id="noteref_588" name="noteref_588" href="#note_588"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">588</span></span></a>
As Corcyra was founded from Corinth before
the commencement of the tyranny of the Cypselidæ,
we find that in the latter state annual prytanes, chosen
apparently from among the aristocracy, remained the
supreme magistrates even in a democratic age.<a id="noteref_589" name="noteref_589" href="#note_589"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">589</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The power of the prytanis, as has been already
mentioned, came next in order in that of king, and
hence the ancient Charon of Lampsacus called the Spartan kings
<span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">prytanes</span></span>;<a id="noteref_590" name="noteref_590" href="#note_590"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">590</span></span></a> which was also the proper
name of one of them. The early kings of Delphi
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page139">[pg 139]</span><a name="Pg139" id="Pg139" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
were also, at least about 360 B.C., called prytanes;<a id="noteref_591" name="noteref_591" href="#note_591"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">591</span></span></a>
in which state there was for a long time an aristocratic
government, similar to that which prevailed in the
Homeric age.<a id="noteref_592" name="noteref_592" href="#note_592"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">592</span></span></a> The number of the prytanes was in
general only one or two.<a id="noteref_593" name="noteref_593" href="#note_593"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">593</span></span></a> At Rhodes there were two
in a year, each of whom had the precedence for six
months;<a id="noteref_594" name="noteref_594" href="#note_594"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">594</span></span></a> so that sometimes one, sometimes two prytanes
are mentioned: they managed the public affairs
with great power in the Prytaneum, in which building
the archives of the city were preserved, and foreign
ambassadors received.<a id="noteref_595" name="noteref_595" href="#note_595"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">595</span></span></a> Yet their powers cannot have
been excessive in the free constitution, which Rhodes,
at its most flourishing period, enjoyed. For the senate,
which was chosen on purely democratic principles,
as we shall see below, shared the management
of all public affairs with the prytanes; the people,
however, exercised the supreme power in the general
assembly, voted by cheirotonia,<a id="noteref_596" name="noteref_596" href="#note_596"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">596</span></span></a> and does not
appear to have been even led in its deliberations by the magistrates
alone.<a id="noteref_597" name="noteref_597" href="#note_597"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">597</span></span></a> Yet the government of Rhodes was
never, up to the time of the Roman dominion, a complete
democracy;<a id="noteref_598" name="noteref_598" href="#note_598"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">598</span></span></a>
perhaps it approximated at the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page140">[pg 140]</span><a name="Pg140" id="Pg140" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
period of the greatest power of these islanders to the
<span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">politeia</span></span> of Aristotle.<a id="noteref_599" name="noteref_599" href="#note_599"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">599</span></span></a> But the power of the prytanes,
who were also the chief magistrates in Ionian, and
especially Æolian<a id="noteref_600" name="noteref_600" href="#note_600"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">600</span></span></a> states, was not everywhere so
wisely restrained; in Miletus their authority was
nearly despotic.<a id="noteref_601" name="noteref_601" href="#note_601"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">601</span></span></a> In all places the prytanes inherited
from the kings the celebration of public sacrifices,
which they generally performed in particular buildings
in the market-place, on the common hearth of
the state. So the prytanis of Tenedos, to whom Pindar
has composed an ode for the sacrifice upon entrance
into his office (εἰσιτήριον). In Cos a divination
from fire was probably connected with the sacrifices
of the prytanis.<a id="noteref_602" name="noteref_602" href="#note_602"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">602</span></span></a> These sacrifices, the public banquets,
together with the reception of foreign ambassadors,
belonged at Athens to the fifty prytanes, as was
the case at Rhodes and Cos. But the political signification
of the name had, under the democratic government
of Athens, become entirely different from
that which it bore in other more aristocratic constitutions.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. The striking dissimilarity in the duties of the
prytanes in the Athenian and in the early constitutions
of Greece, and a conviction that the democracy
of Athens, although relatively modern, had so completely
brought into oblivion the former institutions,
that they can be only recognised in insulated traces
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page141">[pg 141]</span><a name="Pg141" id="Pg141" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and names which had lost their ancient meaning, encourage
me to offer some conjectures on the original
nature of the office held by the prytanes of Athens.
There was at Athens a court of justice in the prytaneum
(ἐπὶ πρυτανείῳ), which, in the times of which
we have an historical account, only possessed the
remnants of a formerly extensive criminal jurisdiction.<a id="noteref_603" name="noteref_603" href="#note_603"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">603</span></span></a>
Now that this had once been the chief court
in Athens is proved by the name <span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">prytanea</span></span>, which
were fees deposited by the parties before each lawsuit,
according to the amount of value in question,
and which served for the maintenance of the judges.<a id="noteref_604" name="noteref_604" href="#note_604"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">604</span></span></a>
The name proves that these monies had at one time
been the pay of the prytanes, in their judicial capacity,
like the gifts in Homer and Hesiod. Furthermore
we know that the ancient financial office of the
colacretæ at one time, as their name testifies, collected
their share of the animals sacrificed (which exactly
resembles the perquisites of the kings at Sparta), and
that they always continued to manage the banquets in
the Prytaneum, and at a later time collected the justice-fees,
for example, these very prytanea.<a id="noteref_605" name="noteref_605" href="#note_605"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">605</span></span></a> From
the connexion between these functions, which has not
been entirely obliterated, it is manifest that the ancient judicial prytanes formed
a company or <span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">syssition</span></span>, dined
in public, were fed at the public expense, and, with
regard to their revenues, had stept into the rights of
the kings, whose share in the sacrifices and justice-fees
had formerly been collected by the colacretæ.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Although there appears to be nothing inconsistent in
this account, it is nevertheless singular that a whole
court of justice bore the name of prytanes, whereas
in other states the number of these magistrates was
always very small; and hence we are led to conjecture
that the prytanes, as in other places, were merely the
leaders and presidents of this supreme court. It is,
however, certain that in later times the phylobasileis
presided in the Prytaneum, four eupatridæ, who were
at the head of the four ancient tribes; and doubtless
performed other duties than the sacred functions which
are ascribed to them;<a id="noteref_606" name="noteref_606" href="#note_606"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">606</span></span></a> like the phylarchs of Epidamnus,
whose extensive duties were in later times transferred
to a senate.<a id="noteref_607" name="noteref_607" href="#note_607"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">607</span></span></a> We must therefore suppose that
these phylobasileis, who, in consequence of political
changes, had at an early period fallen into oblivion,
were once, under the name of prytanes, one of the
highest offices of the state. Now these four prytanes,
or phylobasileis, were assisted in their court by the
ephetæ, who, as I have already remarked,<a id="noteref_608" name="noteref_608" href="#note_608"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">608</span></span></a> were
before the time of Solon identical with the court of the
Areopagus, when they had the management of the
criminal jurisdiction, and a superintendence over the
manners of the citizens in an extended sense of the
word. Both these were also duties of the Doric gerusia,
to which the kings stood in nearly the same relation
as the prytanes of Athens to the areopagites or
ephetæ. Their number was fifty-one, which probably
includes the basileus: there could not, however, have
been fifty previously to the new division of the tribes
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page143">[pg 143]</span><a name="Pg143" id="Pg143" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
by Cleisthenes, before which change their number
was forty-eight, according to the four tribes, either with
or without the phylobasileis.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If this view of the subject is correct, there is a
remarkable correspondence, both in their respective
numbers and constitutions, between the criminal court
and the first administrative office in the ancient state
of Athens. These latter were the naucrari. The
naucrari, who were also anciently forty-eight in number,
and fifty after the new division of the tribes, in
early times managed the public revenue, and therefore
fitted out armies and fleets.<a id="noteref_609" name="noteref_609" href="#note_609"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">609</span></span></a> Now Herodotus also
mentions prytanes of the naucrari, who in early times
directed the government of Athens.<a id="noteref_610" name="noteref_610" href="#note_610"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">610</span></span></a> Unless we suppose
the existence of two kinds of prytanes (which
does not appear suitable to the simplicity of ancient
institutions), the same persons must have presided
over both colleges, and have had an equal share in the
jurisdiction and government. The regularity of these
institutions would appear surprising, if we were not
certain that the same order existed in all the ancient
political establishments; at the same time we must
leave the relative powers of many officers, such, for
example, as those of the archons and prytanes, without
any attempt at elucidation.

5. More obscure even than the condition of the
cosmi and prytanes are the origin and powers of the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">artynæ</span></span> at Argos.<a id="noteref_611" name="noteref_611" href="#note_611"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">611</span></span></a> They cannot have arisen at a
late period, for example, after the abolition of the
royalty, since the same office existed in their ancient
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page144">[pg 144]</span><a name="Pg144" id="Pg144" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
colony, Epidaurus, whose constitution resembled that
of Argos only in the more ancient period. Since it
did not originate from the downfall of the royalty, its
origin may, perhaps, have been owing to a division of
the regal authority, perhaps of the civil and military
functions. In Epidaurus the artynæ were presidents
of a large council of one hundred and eighty members:<a id="noteref_612" name="noteref_612" href="#note_612"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">612</span></span></a> in Argos they are mentioned in connexion with
a body of eighty persons, and a (democratic) senate,
of whose respective powers we are entirely ignorant.<a id="noteref_613" name="noteref_613" href="#note_613"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">613</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The present is a convenient occasion for mentioning
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">demiurgi</span></span>, as several grammarians state that they
were in particular a Doric magistracy,<a id="noteref_614" name="noteref_614" href="#note_614"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">614</span></span></a> perhaps, however,
only judging from the form δαμιουργός. These
magistrates were, it is true, not uncommon in Peloponnesus,<a id="noteref_615" name="noteref_615" href="#note_615"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">615</span></span></a>
but they do not occur often in the Doric states.
They existed among the Eleans and Mantineans,<a id="noteref_616" name="noteref_616" href="#note_616"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">616</span></span></a>
the Hermioneans,<a id="noteref_617" name="noteref_617" href="#note_617"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">617</span></span></a> in the Achæan league,<a id="noteref_618" name="noteref_618" href="#note_618"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">618</span></span></a> at

1. It is my intention in the present chapter to collect
and arrange the various accounts respecting the
alterations in the constitution of those Doric states,
which deviated more from their original condition
than Crete and Sparta: having been more affected by
the general revolutions of the Greek governments, and
drawn with greater violence into the strong current of
political change.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And first, with regard to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Argos</span></span>, I will extract the
following particulars from former parts of this work.
There were in this state three classes of persons; the
inhabitants of the city, who were for the most part
Dorians, distributed into four tribes; a class of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page146">[pg 146]</span><a name="Pg146" id="Pg146" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Periœci, and also a class of bondslaves, named gymnesii.<a id="noteref_623" name="noteref_623" href="#note_623"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">623</span></span></a>
The kings, who were at first of the Heraclide
family, and afterwards of another dynasty, reigned
until the time of the Persian war;<a id="noteref_624" name="noteref_624" href="#note_624"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">624</span></span></a> there were also
officers named artynæ, and a senate possessing extensive
powers. All these are traces which seem to prove a
considerable resemblance between the constitutions of
Argos and Sparta, at least they show that there was
no essential difference. But this similarity was put
an end to by the destruction of a large portion of the
citizens, in the battle with Cleomenes, and the consequent
admission of many Periœci to the rights of
citizenship.<a id="noteref_625" name="noteref_625" href="#note_625"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">625</span></span></a> Soon after this period, we find
Argos flourishing in population, industry, and wealth;<a id="noteref_626" name="noteref_626" href="#note_626"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">626</span></span></a> and in the enjoyment of a democratic constitution.<a id="noteref_627" name="noteref_627" href="#note_627"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">627</span></span></a> The
latter, however, was ill adapted to acquire the ascendency
in Peloponnesus, which Argos endeavoured to
obtain after the peace of Nicias. Hence the people
appointed a board of twelve men, with full powers to
conclude treaties with any Greek state that was willing
to join their party; but in case of Sparta or Athens
proposing any such alliance, the question was to be
first referred to the whole people.<a id="noteref_628" name="noteref_628" href="#note_628"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">628</span></span></a> The state
also, in order to form the nucleus of an army, levied a body of
well-armed men,<a id="noteref_629" name="noteref_629" href="#note_629"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">629</span></span></a> who were selected from the higher
ranks.<a id="noteref_630" name="noteref_630" href="#note_630"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">630</span></span></a> It was natural that these should endanger
the democracy; and after the battle of Mantinea
(B.C. 418.) they overthrew it, in concert with the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page147">[pg 147]</span><a name="Pg147" id="Pg147" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Lacedæmonians, after having put the demagogues to
death.<a id="noteref_631" name="noteref_631" href="#note_631"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">631</span></span></a> Their dominion, however, only lasted for
eight months, as an insurrection and battle within the
city deprived them of their power, and reinstated the
democracy.<a id="noteref_632" name="noteref_632" href="#note_632"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">632</span></span></a> Alcibiades the Athenian completed this
change by the expulsion of many oligarchs, who were
still remaining in the city;<a id="noteref_633" name="noteref_633" href="#note_633"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">633</span></span></a> afterwards he wished to
overthrow the democracy by means of his friends,<a id="noteref_634" name="noteref_634" href="#note_634"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">634</span></span></a> in
consequence of which they were all killed. Two
parties, however, must have still continued to exist in
this state. Æneas the Tactician relates, that the rich
purposing to attack the people for the second time,
and on a certain night having introduced many soldiers
into the city, the leaders of the people hastily summoned
an assembly, and ordered that every armed man
should that night pass muster in his tribe,<a id="noteref_635" name="noteref_635" href="#note_635"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">635</span></span></a> by which
means the rich were prevented from uniting themselves in a body.
The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">leaders of the people</span></em> (δήμου προστάται<a id="noteref_636" name="noteref_636" href="#note_636"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">636</span></span></a>)
are here manifestly democratic magistrates, who
rose to power during the contests between the opposite
factions, and differed chiefly from the demagogues of
Athens, in that their authority was official, without
which they would not have been able to convene an
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page148">[pg 148]</span><a name="Pg148" id="Pg148" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
assembly of the people. For although the appellation
of δήμου προστάτης in the Doric states, as well as at
Athens, sometimes denotes merely a person who by his
character and eloquence had placed himself at the head
of the people; we shall produce hereafter certain
proofs, when we speak of Gela and Calymna, that it
was also the title of a public officer.<a id="noteref_637" name="noteref_637" href="#note_637"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">637</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When, during the peace of Artaxerxes, the Lacedæmonians
had ceased to possess any extensive share
in the direction of public affairs in Peloponnesus, a
spirit of ungovernable licentiousness and ochlocracy
arose in those cities which had hitherto been under an
oligarchical rule; everywhere there were vexatious
accusations, banishments, and confiscations of property,
especially of the property of such persons as had filled
public offices under the guidance of Sparta, though,
even during that period, (B.C. 374.) Argos had been
a place of refuge for banished democrats.<a id="noteref_638" name="noteref_638" href="#note_638"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">638</span></span></a> But after
the battle of Leuctra, when the power of Lacedæmon
was completely broken, and Peloponnesus had for a
certain time lost its leader, the greatest anarchy began
to prevail in Argos. Demagogues stirred up the
people so violently against all privileged or distinguished
persons, that the latter thought themselves
driven to plot the overthrow of the democracy.<a id="noteref_639" name="noteref_639" href="#note_639"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">639</span></span></a>
The scheme was discovered, and the people raged with the
greatest ferocity against the real or supposed conspirators.
On this occasion, more than 1200 of the
chief persons (many upon mere suspicion) were put to
death;<a id="noteref_640" name="noteref_640" href="#note_640"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">640</span></span></a> and at length the demagogues, fearing to carry
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page149">[pg 149]</span><a name="Pg149" id="Pg149" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
through the measures which themselves had originated,
suffered the same fate. This state of things was called
by the name of σκυταλισμὸς, or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">club-law</span></span>; it appears
to have been a time when the strongest man was the
most powerful. When the Athenians heard of these
transactions, they purified their market-place, thinking
that the whole of Greece was polluted by such atrocities:<a id="noteref_641" name="noteref_641" href="#note_641"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">641</span></span></a>
it was probably at the same time that the
Argives themselves offered an expiatory sacrifice to the
mild Zeus (Ζεὺς Μειλίχιος), for the free blood which
had been shed.<a id="noteref_642" name="noteref_642" href="#note_642"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">642</span></span></a> Notwithstanding these
proceedings, the rich and distinguished continued to be persecuted at
Argos with the greatest violence;<a id="noteref_643" name="noteref_643" href="#note_643"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">643</span></span></a> for which the ostracism,
a custom introduced from Athens,<a id="noteref_644" name="noteref_644" href="#note_644"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">644</span></span></a> together
with other democratic institutions,<a id="noteref_645" name="noteref_645" href="#note_645"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">645</span></span></a> was
the chief instrument. In times such as these, the chief and most
noble features of the Doric character necessarily disappeared;
the unfortunate termination of nearly all
military undertakings<a id="noteref_646" name="noteref_646" href="#note_646"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">646</span></span></a> proves the decline of
bravery. In so unsettled a state of public affairs, sycophancy and
violence became prevalent:<a id="noteref_647" name="noteref_647" href="#note_647"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">647</span></span></a> notwithstanding which,
their eagerness and attention to public speaking produced
no orator, whose fame was sufficient to descend
to posterity.<a id="noteref_648" name="noteref_648" href="#note_648"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">648</span></span></a>

2. In <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Epidaurus</span></span>, on the other hand, the aristocracy
continued in force, and accordingly this city
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page150">[pg 150]</span><a name="Pg150" id="Pg150" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
was as much attached to the Spartans, as Argos was
disinclined to them. Of the artynæ in this state, and
of the senate of 180, as well as of the class of cultivators,
and of the tribes, we have spoken in former
parts of this work.<a id="noteref_649" name="noteref_649" href="#note_649"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">649</span></span></a>

As long as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Ægina</span></span> remained an independent state,
the government was held by the hereditary aristocracy,
whose titular dignity was probably increased by the
power derived from the possession of great wealth.
The insurrection of a democratic party remained fruitless.
Ægina and Corinth are decisive proofs, that
under an aristocratical government an active and enterprising
spirit of commerce may arise and flourish.

The Epidaurian colony, Cos, without doubt, originally
adopted the constitution of its mother-state.
Before the 75th (probably about the 73rd or 74th)
Olympiad, we find a tyrant appointed by the king of
Persia reigning in this island, Cadmus, the son of
Scythes of Zancle;<a id="noteref_650" name="noteref_650" href="#note_650"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">650</span></span></a> after some time,

3. In the Argive colony of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Rhodes</span></span>, it may be supposed
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page151">[pg 151]</span><a name="Pg151" id="Pg151" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that an ancient Doric constitution existed; for
there were kings of the Heraclide family, and probably
also a council with the same powers as the Spartan
gerusia. The royalty expired after the 30th Olympiad
(660 B.C.); but the ancient family of the Eratidæ at
Ialysus, retained a considerable share in the government;
probably exercising nearly the powers of a
prytanis. Pindar shows that the frame of justice
belonged to this once royal family,<a id="noteref_654" name="noteref_654" href="#note_654"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">654</span></span></a> when he says,
<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Give, O father Zeus, to Diagoras favour both with
citizens and with strangers, since he walks constantly
in the way opposed to violence, knowing
well what the just minds of noble ancestors have
inspired in him. Destroy not the common progeny
of Callianax. At the solemnities for the victory
of the Eratidæ, the whole city rejoices in banquets.
Yet in a moment of time many winds meet from
many quarters.</span></span>”</span> Pindar thus early (464 B.C.)
predicts the dangers that then awaited the ancient
family, to which Rhodes owed so much, from the
growing influence of Athens;<a id="noteref_655" name="noteref_655" href="#note_655"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">655</span></span></a> throughout the whole
ode he cautions the citizens against precipitate innovation,
and prays for the continuance of the ancient
firmly-seated constitution.<a id="noteref_656" name="noteref_656" href="#note_656"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">656</span></span></a> Both prophecies were
fulfilled. The sons of Diagoras were condemned to
death, and banished by the Athenians, as heads of the
aristocracy; but the hero Dorieus returned to his

with them against the enemies of his family, as a faithful
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page152">[pg 152]</span><a name="Pg152" id="Pg152" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
partisan of the Spartans. He was taken by the
Athenians in the year 405 B.C., who, when about to
condemn him, were moved by the appearance of the
noble son of Diagoras (whose boldness of spirit corresponded
with the size and beauty peculiar to his
family), to release him from imprisonment and death.<a id="noteref_657" name="noteref_657" href="#note_657"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">657</span></span></a>
The ancient fortune of the Rhodians, which was owing
to their strict adherence to the Doric customs, and
to their great commercial activity, was interrupted by
the troubles of the Peloponnesian war, in which the
alternation of the Athenian and Lacedæmonian influence
by turns introduced democracy and aristocracy.
At the time of the Sicilian expedition, Rhodes was
under the power of Athens;<a id="noteref_658" name="noteref_658" href="#note_658"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">658</span></span></a> but the Spartans having
in 412 B.C. obtained the superiority in this island,<a id="noteref_659" name="noteref_659" href="#note_659"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">659</span></span></a> and Dorieus having been recalled by them (413 B.C.)
in order to suppress internal dissensions, the governing
power again reverted to the nobles: these latter
having been compelled to unite against the people by
the demagogues, who, while they distributed the public
money among the people in the shape of salaries, had
not repaid the sums due to the trierarchs, and at the
same time vexed them by continual lawsuits.<a id="noteref_660" name="noteref_660" href="#note_660"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">660</span></span></a> Soon
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page153">[pg 153]</span><a name="Pg153" id="Pg153" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
after this period (408 B.C.),<a id="noteref_661" name="noteref_661" href="#note_661"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">661</span></span></a> the large city of Rhodes
was founded, by collecting to one spot the inhabitants
of the three small cities of the island, Lindus, Ialysus,
and Camirus. But in 396 B.C. Rhodes was again recovered
by Conon to Athens, and became democratical;<a id="noteref_662" name="noteref_662" href="#note_662"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">662</span></span></a>
yet in five years (391 B.C.) the Spartan
party was again victorious;<a id="noteref_663" name="noteref_663" href="#note_663"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">663</span></span></a> and the Social War finally
put an end to the influence of the Athenians. From
this time the interference of the Carian rulers,
Mausolus and Artemisia, commenced, by which the
oligarchy was greatly raised, and the democratical
party driven out; to restore which, and to regard rather
the cause of popular freedom in Greece, than the injuries
received from the Rhodians, was the advice of
Demosthenes to the Athenians.<a id="noteref_664" name="noteref_664" href="#note_664"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">664</span></span></a> At that time a
Carian garrison was in the Acropolis of Rhodes.
Out of these troubles and dissensions a constitution
arose, in which, as far as we are able to ascertain,
democracy prevailed, although the small number and
extensive powers of the prytanes prove that it was not
unmixed with aristocratical elements. According to
the description which Cicero puts in the mouth of the
younger Scipio, at this time all the members of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page154">[pg 154]</span><a name="Pg154" id="Pg154" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
senate belonged (in the same year) to the public
assembly, and sat in alternate months (probably periods
of six months, like the prytanes) in the senate and
among the people; in both capacities they received pay
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">conventicium</span></span>): the same persons also sometimes
sat as judges among the people in the theatre, sometimes
in the senate in criminal and other cases.<a id="noteref_665" name="noteref_665" href="#note_665"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">665</span></span></a> These
statements cannot be easily reconciled with Strabo's
view of the constitution, and yet there can be no doubt
that he, as well as Cicero, speaks of the time preceding
Cassius' conquest of Rhodes. <span class="tei tei-q">“The Rhodians,”</span> he
says, <span class="tei tei-q">“though not under a democratic government,
took great care of the people; in order to support
the number of poor in the state, they provided them
with corn, and the rich maintained the poor according
to an ancient custom; there were also liturgies,
by which the people were furnished with meat, &amp;c.”</span><a id="noteref_666" name="noteref_666" href="#note_666"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">666</span></span></a> Notwithstanding the democratic institution of the senate,
many offices, those perhaps in particular which
were connected with the administration, such for example
as the superintendence of the marine, were
managed on oligarchical principles; the internal quiet
of Rhodes at this period is also a proof against the
existence of an unmixed democracy. Accordingly, the
true Doric characteristics were here retained for a
longer time than in most other Doric states; viz.,
courage, constancy, patriotism, with a haughty sternness
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page155">[pg 155]</span><a name="Pg155" id="Pg155" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of manners, and a certain temperance, which was
indeed in some manner contrasted with their magnificence
in meals, buildings, and all arts.<a id="noteref_667" name="noteref_667" href="#note_667"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">667</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Corinth</span></span>, delivered by Sparta from its tyrants,
had again reverted to its former constitution, which
however was not so oligarchical as the hereditary aristocracy
of the Bacchiadæ. Some noble families, as
the Oligæthidæ,<a id="noteref_668" name="noteref_668" href="#note_668"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">668</span></span></a> had a priority, probably the gerusia
was composed of them; and the public assembly was
restricted in a manner similar to that of Sparta. But
at the same time Pindar celebrates Corinth as <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the
city in which Eunomia</span></span> (or good government) <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">dwells,
and her sisters, the firm supports of cities, Justice
and Peace, the bestowers of riches, who know how
to keep off Violence, the bold mother of Arrogance</span></span>.”</span>
From these words it may also be conjectured, that the
aristocratical party was compelled to resist the endeavours
made by the people to extend their power:
it remained, however, unshaken up to the date of the
Peloponnesian war, and Corinth, with the exception of
a short time, continued the faithful ally of Sparta, and
foe of Athens.<a id="noteref_669" name="noteref_669" href="#note_669"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">669</span></span></a> At a later period, a democratic party,
which relied upon Argos, rose in Corinth, by the assistance
of Persian money: this at first obtained the
supreme power, and afterwards attacked the Lacedæmonian
party, consisting of the noble families, at the
festival of the Euclea; and at last proceeded so far, as
to wish to abolish the independence of Corinth, and to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page156">[pg 156]</span><a name="Pg156" id="Pg156" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
incorporate it completely with Argos (B.C. 395 and
394.)<a id="noteref_670" name="noteref_670" href="#note_670"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">670</span></span></a> The banished aristocrats, supported by some
Lacedæmonians who were quartered at Sicyon, continued
nevertheless to keep up a contest, and maintained
themselves at Lechæum;<a id="noteref_671" name="noteref_671" href="#note_671"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">671</span></span></a> after this they must
have returned and restored the ancient constitution:
for we find Corinth again true to the Lacedæmonian
alliance.<a id="noteref_672" name="noteref_672" href="#note_672"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">672</span></span></a> In the time of Dion (356 B.C.) Corinth
was under a government nearly oligarchical, little
business being transacted in the popular assembly:<a id="noteref_673" name="noteref_673" href="#note_673"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">673</span></span></a>
and although this body sent Timoleon as general of
the state to Sicily (B.C. 345.), there was then in
existence a gerusia (a name completely aristocratic),
which not only treated with foreign ambassadors, but
also, which is very remarkable, exercised a criminal
jurisdiction.<a id="noteref_674" name="noteref_674" href="#note_674"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">674</span></span></a> The tyranny of Timophanes, who
was slain by Timoleon, was, according to Aristotle, a short
interruption of the oligarchy.<a id="noteref_675" name="noteref_675" href="#note_675"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">675</span></span></a>

5. From the moderate and well-balanced constitution,
which Corinth had upon the whole the good fortune
to possess, its colony <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Corcyra</span></span> had at an early
period departed. Founded under the guidance of
Chersicrates, a Bacchiad, it was for a time governed by
the Corinthian families, which had first taken possession
of the colony. At the same time, however, a
popular party was formed, which obtained a greater
power by the violent disruption of Corcyra from its
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page157">[pg 157]</span><a name="Pg157" id="Pg157" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
mother-country, and the hostile relation in which the
two states were thus placed. In addition to these
differences, the connexion between Corcyra and the
Peloponnesian league had been relaxed, and was replaced
by a closer intimacy with Athens; so that while
the aristocratic party had lost its hold, the democratic
influence had taken a deep root. The people also
strengthened themselves by the union of a numerous
class of slaves.<a id="noteref_676" name="noteref_676" href="#note_676"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">676</span></span></a> By means of this combined force,
the aristocratical party was overthrown, whose expulsion
was attended with such scenes of blood and atrocity, as
were hardly known in any other state of Greece.<a id="noteref_677" name="noteref_677" href="#note_677"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">677</span></span></a> But
even before these occurrences the constitution had been
democratical.<a id="noteref_678" name="noteref_678" href="#note_678"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">678</span></span></a> The popular assembly had the supreme
power; and although the senate had perhaps a greater
authority than at Athens,<a id="noteref_679" name="noteref_679" href="#note_679"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">679</span></span></a> it was manifestly only a part
of the <span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">demus</span></span>:<a id="noteref_680" name="noteref_680" href="#note_680"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">680</span></span></a> leaders of the people appear to have been in this, as well as in
other states, a regular office.<a id="noteref_681" name="noteref_681" href="#note_681"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">681</span></span></a>
From this time the most unbounded freedom prevailed
at Corcyra, of which the Greek proverb says coarsely
indeed, but expressively, Ἑλευθέρα Κόρκυρα, χέζ᾽ ὅπου
θέλεις.<a id="noteref_682" name="noteref_682" href="#note_682"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">682</span></span></a> The Corcyreans were active, industrious, and
enterprising, good sailors, and active merchants; but
they had entirely lost the stability and noble features
of the Doric character. In absence of all modesty
they even exceeded the Athenians, among whom the
very dogs, as a certain philosopher said, were more
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page158">[pg 158]</span><a name="Pg158" id="Pg158" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
impudent than in any other place: fabulous reports
were circulated in Greece, respecting the excessive
luxury of the successors of the Phæacians.<a id="noteref_683" name="noteref_683" href="#note_683"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">683</span></span></a> Yet even
in this state an antidemocratic party, inclined to the
Lacedæmonians, was never entirely expelled; and it
frequently rose against the people without success,<a id="noteref_684" name="noteref_684" href="#note_684"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">684</span></span></a> but in the

the chief magistrates of Corcyra, seem not to have
been entirely democratic magistrates, although the government
was democratical; besides these officers, there
occur in an important monument,<a id="noteref_687" name="noteref_687" href="#note_687"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">687</span></span></a> πρόδικοι βουλᾶς,

colonies, we will immediately proceed to
consider the state of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Syracuse</span></span>. In the Syracusan
constitution the following were the chief epochs. In
the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">first</span></em>, the government was in the hands of the
gamori,<a id="noteref_703" name="noteref_703" href="#note_703"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">703</span></span></a> originally together with a king,<a id="noteref_704" name="noteref_704" href="#note_704"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">704</span></span></a> whose

who took possession of the large estates cultivated
by native bondslaves, and exercised the chief governing
power. It is probable that the magistrates,
and the members of the council,<a id="noteref_706" name="noteref_706" href="#note_706"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">706</span></span></a> who were leaders
of the people in the assembly (ἁλία), were chosen
from this body; in the same manner as the geomori
of Samos formed a council, which after the subversion

these authorities, the people, having gradually become
more pressing in their demands, at length rebelled,
and expelled them, by combining with their
slaves the Cyllyrii (before B.C. 492.<a id="noteref_708" name="noteref_708" href="#note_708"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">708</span></span></a>); but the democracy
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page162">[pg 162]</span><a name="Pg162" id="Pg162" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

to whom the city, overcome by difficulties, intrusted
the unlimited disposal of its welfare. With the
overthrow of this dynasty, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">second</span></em> period begins,
during which there was upon the whole a moderate
constitution, called by most writers democracy,<a id="noteref_712" name="noteref_712" href="#note_712"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">712</span></span></a> and
by Aristotle distinguished from democracy as a
<span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">politeia</span></span>,
in his peculiar sense of the word.<a id="noteref_713" name="noteref_713" href="#note_713"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">713</span></span></a> Immediately
after the downfall of Thrasybulus an assembly
was convened, in which it was debated concerning
the constitution. The public offices were only
to be filled by the ancient citizens; while those
who had been admitted by Gelon from other cities,
together with the naturalized mercenaries,<a id="noteref_714" name="noteref_714" href="#note_714"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">714</span></span></a> were not
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page163">[pg 163]</span><a name="Pg163" id="Pg163" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to enjoy the complete rights of citizenship:<a id="noteref_715" name="noteref_715" href="#note_715"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">715</span></span></a>
measures which occasioned a war within the walls of
Syracuse. Lastly, in this, as well as in the other
states of Sicily, peace was re-established by the restoration
of the ancient citizens, a separation of the foreigners,
who found a settlement at Messana, and a
new allotment of the lands,<a id="noteref_716" name="noteref_716" href="#note_716"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">716</span></span></a> in which the estates of
the nobles were probably divided anew. At the same
time, by the violence of these proceedings, the states
of Sicily were reduced to a feeble condition, which
occasioned numerous attempts to set up a tyranny.
As a security against this danger, the people (in 454
B.C.) established the institution called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">petalism</span></span>, in
imitation of the ostracism of Athens; but they had
sufficient discernment soon to abolish this new form
of tyranny, as all distinguished and well educated men<a id="noteref_717" name="noteref_717" href="#note_717"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">717</span></span></a>
were deterred by it from taking a part in public affairs.
Syracuse suffered at that time, as well as Athens, by
the intrigues of demagogues and cabals of sycophants.<a id="noteref_718" name="noteref_718" href="#note_718"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">718</span></span></a>
In this city, at an early period, a talent for
the subtleties of oratory had begun to develope itself;
which owed its origin to Corax, a man employed by
Hieron as a secret spy and confidant, and celebrated
among the people as a powerful orator and sagacious
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page164">[pg 164]</span><a name="Pg164" id="Pg164" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

temperament of the Sicilian Greeks<a id="noteref_720" name="noteref_720" href="#note_720"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">720</span></span></a> had already
turned towards cunning and deceit; and in particular
the young, eager after all novelty, ran counter to the
temperance and severity of the ancient customs and
mode of life.<a id="noteref_721" name="noteref_721" href="#note_721"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">721</span></span></a> As to the constitution at the time of
the Sicilian war, we know that all public affairs of
importance were decided in the popular assembly,<a id="noteref_722" name="noteref_722" href="#note_722"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">722</span></span></a> and
the management of them was in great part confided
to the leaders of the people (δήμου προστάται), who
seem to have been regular public officers.<a id="noteref_723" name="noteref_723" href="#note_723"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">723</span></span></a> In what
manner the people was led, is shown by the instance
of Athenagoras, who represents the expedition of the
Athenians, when already approaching the shores of
Sicily, as a story invented by the oligarchs to terrify
the people. To what extent a complete freedom of
speaking before the people existed, is not altogether
clear.<a id="noteref_724" name="noteref_724" href="#note_724"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">724</span></span></a> That persons of an aristocratic disposition
still continued to possess political power, is evident
from the speech of Athenagoras;<a id="noteref_725" name="noteref_725" href="#note_725"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">725</span></span></a> and it is probable
from Aristotle, that they had an exclusive right to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page165">[pg 165]</span><a name="Pg165" id="Pg165" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
certain offices. The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">third</span></em> period begins with the
victory over the Athenian armament. As this was
decided by the fleet of the Syracusans, the men of
inferior rank, who served as sailors, obtained a large
increase of importance in their own sight, and were
loud in their demands for admission to the highest
offices; in the very same manner as at Athens, after
the battle of Salamis. In 412 B.C., upon the proposal
of Diocles the demagogue,<a id="noteref_726" name="noteref_726" href="#note_726"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">726</span></span></a> a commission was
appointed for the arrangement of a new constitution,
in which the original contriver of the plan had himself
the first place. The government was thus converted
into a complete democracy, of which the first principle
was, that the public offices should be filled not
by election, but by lot.<a id="noteref_727" name="noteref_727" href="#note_727"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">727</span></span></a> There was formed at the
same time a collection of written laws, which were
very precise and explicit in the determination of
punishments, and were doubtless intended, by their
severity, to keep off those troubles, which the new
constitution could not fail to produce. This code,
which was also adopted by other Sicilian states, was
written in an ancient native dialect, which seventy
years afterwards (in the time of Timoleon) required
an interpreter.<a id="noteref_728" name="noteref_728" href="#note_728"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">728</span></span></a> Notwithstanding these
precautions, we find the democracy an Olympiad and a half later
fallen into such contempt,<a id="noteref_729" name="noteref_729" href="#note_729"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">729</span></span></a> that the people,
utterly incapable of protecting the city in the dangers of
the time, appointed a general with unlimited power:
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page166">[pg 166]</span><a name="Pg166" id="Pg166" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
which measure, though always attended with bad
success, they repeatedly had recourse to. Dionysius,
a man powerful as well from his talents, as from the
means which his situation as demagogue afforded him
of keeping the people in continual dread of the
nobles,<a id="noteref_730" name="noteref_730" href="#note_730"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">730</span></span></a> soon became tyrant;<a id="noteref_731" name="noteref_731" href="#note_731"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">731</span></span></a> but he still allowed an
appearance of freedom to remain in public assemblies,
which he summoned, conducted, and dismissed.<a id="noteref_732" name="noteref_732" href="#note_732"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">732</span></span></a>
Dion restored the democracy for a short time, and
only partially;<a id="noteref_733" name="noteref_733" href="#note_733"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">733</span></span></a> for it was his real
intention to introduce a Doric aristocracy upon the model of those in
Sparta and Crete.<a id="noteref_734" name="noteref_734" href="#note_734"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">734</span></span></a> Timoleon with
more decision abolished the democracy, and restored the former
constitution,<a id="noteref_735" name="noteref_735" href="#note_735"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">735</span></span></a> as may be supposed, not without
sycophants and demagogues, who were not slow to turn
their arms against the founder of the new liberty.<a id="noteref_736" name="noteref_736" href="#note_736"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">736</span></span></a> A mixture of aristocracy is discernible in the office of
amphipolus of the Olympian Zeus, which lasted three
centuries from 343 B.C. and probably combined political
influence with the highest dignity; the person
who filled it gave his name to the year. Three candidates
were chosen for this office from three families
by vote, and one of the three was selected by lot.<a id="noteref_737" name="noteref_737" href="#note_737"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">737</span></span></a>

It may be observed, that Timoleon caused a revision
of the laws to be made by Cephalus, a Corinthian,
who, however, was only called an interpreter of the
code of Diocles, although, as it appears, he entirely
remodelled the civil law.<a id="noteref_738" name="noteref_738" href="#note_738"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">738</span></span></a> We must pass
hastily over the later times, remarking in general, that a feeble
democracy continued to exist, frequently contending
with clubs of oligarchs,<a id="noteref_739" name="noteref_739" href="#note_739"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">739</span></span></a> and afterwards falling into
the hand of tyrants who had risen from demagogues;
such, for instance, as Agathocles, who undertook to
bring about a redivision of the lands, and an abolition
of all claims of debt.<a id="noteref_740" name="noteref_740" href="#note_740"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">740</span></span></a> Hiero II. did not suppress the
council of the city, which Hieronymus never consulted;
but as it again returned into existence immediately

8. After this account of the constitution of Syracuse,
we may proceed to notice those of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Gela</span></span>, and
its colony <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Agrigentum</span></span>; as these cities, though deriving
their origin from Rhodes, perhaps took Syracuse
for their model in the formation of their government.
In both states the noble and wealthy first
held the ruling power; which was afterwards for a
long time possessed by tyrants.<a id="noteref_744" name="noteref_744" href="#note_744"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">744</span></span></a> Agrigentum, after
the overthrow of Thrasydæus in 473 B.C., received
a democratic constitution:<a id="noteref_745" name="noteref_745" href="#note_745"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">745</span></span></a> we know, however, that
at that time an assembly of a thousand, appointed for
three years, governed the state. This assembly was
suppressed by Empedocles the philosopher;<a id="noteref_746" name="noteref_746" href="#note_746"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">746</span></span></a> who obtained

a thousand also occurs in Rhegium and Croton, in
speaking of which city we will again mention this
subject. Further than this all information fails us.
Scipio established anew the senate of Agrigentum,

the tyrants had, as in other states, been the leaders of
a democratic party;<a id="noteref_758" name="noteref_758" href="#note_758"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">758</span></span></a>

an early constitution was restored, which remained
unshaken during the Peloponnesian war. We are
only informed that in 418 B.C. the Lacedæmonians
made the constitution more oligarchical;<a id="noteref_760" name="noteref_760" href="#note_760"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">760</span></span></a> that it
had not previously been entirely democratical, is shown by
the fidelity with which Sicyon adhered to the head of
the Peloponnesian league. After the battle of Leuctra
we find that Sicyon possessed an Achæan constitution,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, one founded on property, in which the rich were
supreme;<a id="noteref_761" name="noteref_761" href="#note_761"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">761</span></span></a> Euphron, in 369 B.C., undertook
to change this into a democracy, and thus obtained the
tyranny, until the party of the nobles, whom he persecuted,
overthrew him.<a id="noteref_762" name="noteref_762" href="#note_762"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">762</span></span></a> Plutarch states most

As <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Phlius</span></span> during the whole Peloponnesian war
remained faithful to the interest of Sparta and hostile
to Argos, it is evident that the state was under an
aristocratic government.<a id="noteref_764" name="noteref_764" href="#note_764"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">764</span></span></a> In a revolution which took
place before 383 B.C. the Lacedæmonian party had
been expelled, but were in the same year again received
by the people; the government, however, did
not become democratical, until Agesilaus, introduced
by the former party, conquered the city, and remodelled
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page171">[pg 171]</span><a name="Pg171" id="Pg171" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

period the democratic assembly consisted of more
than 5000 members, those who were inclined to the
Lacedæmonians furnished above 1000 heavy-armed
soldiers. A very regular system of government is
proved to have existed, by the patience and heroism
with which the Phliasians, in 372-376 B.C., defended
their city and country against the attacks of
the Argives, Arcadians, Eleans, and Thebans, until,
without breaking their fidelity to Sparta, they concluded
a peace with Thebes and Argos (366 B.C.).

by persons who had fought against the people.<a id="noteref_772" name="noteref_772" href="#note_772"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">772</span></span></a> It is probable that the consequence of this return was
the revolt of Megara from Athens, in 446 B.C.;<a id="noteref_773" name="noteref_773" href="#note_773"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">773</span></span></a> in the beginning of the Peloponnesian war the Lacedæmonian
party was predominant. But in the eighth
year of the war the aristocratic party of Megara was
in banishment at Pegæ; and when they were about
to be recalled, and restored to their city, the leaders
of the people preferred to have the Athenians in the
town rather than the citizens whom they had driven
from their walls. By the influence of Brasidas, however,
they returned, upon a promise of amnesty, which
they did not long observe. For having first obtained
the supreme offices (to which they must therefore
have had a particular claim), they brought a hundred
of their chief enemies before the people, and forced
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page173">[pg 173]</span><a name="Pg173" id="Pg173" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
them to pass sentence upon the accused with open
votes. The people, terrified by this measure, condemned
them to death. At the same time the dominant
party established a close and strict oligarchy,<a id="noteref_774" name="noteref_774" href="#note_774"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">774</span></span></a>

In 375 B.C., we again find that democracy was the
established constitution, and that the attempts of the
oligarchs to change it were defeated.<a id="noteref_776" name="noteref_776" href="#note_776"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">776</span></span></a>
Demosthenes<a id="noteref_777" name="noteref_777" href="#note_777"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">777</span></span></a>
mentions a court of three hundred in this state, sitting
in judgment on public offences; and at this time
nobility and wealth were frequently united in the same
persons. Of the Megarian magistrates we have
already mentioned a king,<a id="noteref_778" name="noteref_778" href="#note_778"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">778</span></span></a> to which may now be
added the hieromnamon, an office always held by the
priest of Poseidon,<a id="noteref_779" name="noteref_779" href="#note_779"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">779</span></span></a> and probably having the same
duties and privileges as the amphipolus, hierapolus,
and hierothytes in the Sicilian states. The antiquity
of this office is evident from its occurrence in the
colonies of Megara, Byzantium and Chalcedon. In
the former a hieromnamon is mentioned in a decree
quoted by Demosthenes,<a id="noteref_780" name="noteref_780" href="#note_780"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">780</span></span></a> who gives his name to the
year; in the latter, a decree now extant<a id="noteref_781" name="noteref_781" href="#note_781"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">781</span></span></a> mentions first
a king, then a hieromnamon, then a prophet, together
with three nomophylaces, all administering the public
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page174">[pg 174]</span><a name="Pg174" id="Pg174" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
affairs (αἰσυμνῶντες) for the appointed term of a
month. The two first we have already seen united
in the very same manner at Megara; the third refers
to the worship of Apollo, of the transfer of which from
the mother-state to Chalcedon we have already spoken,
and pointed out an oracle of Apollo which was delivered
there;<a id="noteref_782" name="noteref_782" href="#note_782"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">782</span></span></a> the nomophylaces also occur at
Sparta. The hieromnamon was probably priest also of Poseidon
in the colonies, the worship of which god, deriving
its origin from the Isthmus of Corinth, was at least
more prevalent than any other.<a id="noteref_783" name="noteref_783" href="#note_783"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">783</span></span></a>

time in the market-place and the harbour, which the
people had contracted from the situation of the town,
a great dissoluteness of manners existed; and this
was also transferred to the neighbouring city of Chalcedon,
which had adopted the Byzantine democracy,
and, together with its ancient constitution, had lost the
temperance and regularity for which it had been distinguished.
In these times the Byzantians were frequently
in great financial difficulties, from which they
often endeavoured to extricate themselves by violent
measures.<a id="noteref_789" name="noteref_789" href="#note_789"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">789</span></span></a> In the document quoted by Demosthenes,

before the people in the assembly (ἁλία), nearly in
the same manner as was customary at Athens; the

introduced together with the democracy;<a id="noteref_791" name="noteref_791" href="#note_791"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">791</span></span></a> the civil

to all the colonies of Megara, since we find them
in Heraclea on the Pontus. In this city we know to
a certainty that the hundreds were divisions of the
tribes, of which there were three;<a id="noteref_794" name="noteref_794" href="#note_794"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">794</span></span></a> the rich (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, the

hundred; but the demagogues, intending to destroy
the aristocracy, divided the people into sixty new hundreds,
independent of the tribes, in which rich and
poor were entered without distinction: nearly the
same measure as that by which Cleisthenes had so
greatly raised the democracy at Athens.

a change in the constitution.<a id="noteref_797" name="noteref_797" href="#note_797"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">797</span></span></a> Before 364

call in the assistance of Clearchus, an exile, who immediately

marched with a body of soldiers into the

the best means of extirpating an hereditary aristocracy;
but the pride of noble descent was so strong in the
breasts of these women, that the greater number freed
themselves from the disgrace by suicide. It must be
supposed, that a tyranny administered in so violent
a spirit, and continued through several generations,
destroyed every vestige of the ancient constitution.<a id="noteref_801" name="noteref_801" href="#note_801"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">801</span></span></a>

12. In the Spartan colony of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Cnidos</span></span> the government
was a close aristocracy. At the head of the
state was a council of sixty members, who were chosen
from among the nobles. Its powers were precisely
the same as those of the Spartan gerusia, from which
its number is also copied. It debated concerning all
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page178">[pg 178]</span><a name="Pg178" id="Pg178" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
public affairs, previously to their being laid before the
assembly of the people, and had the superintendence
of manners. The office lasted for life, and was subject
to no responsibility.<a id="noteref_802" name="noteref_802" href="#note_802"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">802</span></span></a> The members were styled
ἀμνήμονες, and the president was called ἀφεστὴρ, who
inquired the opinion of each councillor. Only one
person from each family was eligible to the council
and public offices, younger brothers being excluded.
This occasioned dissensions between members of the
same family; those who were not admitted joined the
popular party, and the oligarchy was overthrown.<a id="noteref_803" name="noteref_803" href="#note_803"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">803</span></span></a> This event probably took place a short time before the

13. The changes in the government of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Cyrene</span></span>
we pointed out when speaking of the Periœci. Originally
the constitution was perhaps nearly similar
to that of Sparta. Afterwards the ancient rights of
the colonists came into collision with the claims of
the later settlers, and at the same time the kings
obtained an unconstitutional and nearly tyrannical
power. It appears that they were stimulated by
their connexion, both by friendship and marriage,
with the sovereigns of Egypt, to change the ancient
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page179">[pg 179]</span><a name="Pg179" id="Pg179" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
royalty into an oriental despotism. Hence, in the
reign of Battus III., Demonax the Mantinean, who
was called in to frame a constitution for this city,
restored the supremacy of the community; he likewise
gave to the new colonists equal rights of citizenship
with the ancient citizens, although the latter
doubtless still retained many privileges. The power
of the kings was limited within the narrowest bounds;
and they were only permitted to enjoy the revenues
flowing from the sacerdotal office and their own
lands,<a id="noteref_807" name="noteref_807" href="#note_807"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">807</span></span></a> whereas they had before claimed possession of
the whole property of the state;<a id="noteref_808" name="noteref_808" href="#note_808"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">808</span></span></a>
they had, like the Spartan kings, a seat and vote in the council, and
probably presided over it, which duties were performed
by Pheretime, the mother of Arcesilaus III., during
the absence of her son.<a id="noteref_809" name="noteref_809" href="#note_809"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">809</span></span></a> These restrictions were,
however, violently opposed by the princes just mentioned,
as well as by their successors, who thus drew
upon themselves their own ruin. Arcesilaus also, to
whom Pindar addressed an ode, the fourth of the name,
ruled with harshness, and protected his power by foreign
mercenaries:<a id="noteref_810" name="noteref_810" href="#note_810"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">810</span></span></a> and the poet doubtless advised him
with good reason, although without success, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">not to
destroy with sharp axe the branches of the great
oak</span></span> (the nobles of the state), <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">and disfigure its
beautiful form; for that, even when deprived of its
vigour, it gives proof of its power, when the destructive

people in despair throws itself under the dominion of a

the poet advises that the wounds of the state should be
treated was not that of Arcesilaus, celebrated only for
his boldness and valour. For these reasons he was
the last in the line of the princes of Cyrene (after
457 B.C.), and a democratical government succeeded.
His son Battus took refuge in the islands of the Hesperides,
where he died; and the head of his corpse was
thrown by these republicans into the sea.<a id="noteref_812" name="noteref_812" href="#note_812"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">812</span></span></a> The
new form of government obtained stability and duration by
an entire change; the number of the tribes and phratrias
was increased, the political union of the houses
destroyed, the family rites were incorporated in the
public worship,<a id="noteref_813" name="noteref_813" href="#note_813"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">813</span></span></a> &amp;c. Some element of disturbance
and revolution must, however, have been still left in

contrive for them a temperate and well-ordered government,

on the ground that they seemed too prosperous

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page181">[pg 181]</span><a name="Pg181" id="Pg181" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

14. In the constitution of the Lacedæmonian colony
of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Tarentum</span></span> there were two chief periods. In
the first we must infer, from the analogy of the other
Doric colonies, that there was the same division of
ranks, viz., noble citizens, governing the state under a
king;<a id="noteref_816" name="noteref_816" href="#note_816"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">816</span></span></a> the people, to whom few and limited powers
were allowed; and aboriginal bondsmen, chiefly residing
upon the lands of the highest class.<a id="noteref_817" name="noteref_817" href="#note_817"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">817</span></span></a> This constitution
must, however, have been gradually relaxed;
for Aristotle calls it a <span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">politeia</span></span> in the
limited sense, which, as he informs us, lasted over the Persian war,
and did not pass into a democracy until a large part of
the nobles had been slain in a bloody battle against the
Iapygians (474 B.C.)<a id="noteref_818" name="noteref_818" href="#note_818"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">818</span></span></a> The transition was introduced
without any violent revolution, by some measures,
in which the aristocracy submitted to the claims of
the people. First of all, according to Aristotle,<a id="noteref_819" name="noteref_819" href="#note_819"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">819</span></span></a> they
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page182">[pg 182]</span><a name="Pg182" id="Pg182" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
divided the public property among the poorer classes;
but only gave them the use of it; <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, apparently the
public lands were apportioned out to them; but at the
payment of a small rent, in token that they had not the
absolute property in the soil. Besides this popular
measure, the number of all the public offices was
doubled; and one half was filled by election, the other
by lot; in order, by the latter mode of nomination, to
open a way to their attainment by the lower orders.
This democracy at first promoted to a great degree the
prosperity and power of the state,<a id="noteref_820" name="noteref_820" href="#note_820"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">820</span></span></a> while
persons of character and dignity were at the head of the government;
for example, one of the first men of the time,
Archytas the Pythagorean, a man of singular vigour
and wisdom, who, as well as all adherents of the
Pythagorean league (of which he could not then have
been a member), was of an aristocratical disposition.<a id="noteref_821" name="noteref_821" href="#note_821"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">821</span></span></a>
He was general seven times, although it was prohibited
by law that the same person should hold this office
more than once,<a id="noteref_822" name="noteref_822" href="#note_822"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">822</span></span></a> and never suffered a defeat:<a id="noteref_823" name="noteref_823" href="#note_823"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">823</span></span></a> the
people with a noble confidence entrusted to him for a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page183">[pg 183]</span><a name="Pg183" id="Pg183" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
considerable time the entire management of public
affairs.<a id="noteref_824" name="noteref_824" href="#note_824"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">824</span></span></a> At a subsequent period, however, as there
were no longer any men of this stamp to carry on the
government, and the corruption of manners, caused by
the natural fruitfulness of the country, and restrained
by no strict laws, was continually on the increase, the
state of Tarentum was so entirely changed, that every
trace of the ancient Doric character, and particularly
of the mother-country, disappeared; hence, although
externally powerful and wealthy, it was from its real

15. On the constitution of the Tarentine colony
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Heraclea</span></span> (433 B.C.) the monuments extant, although
important in other respects, afford little information.
In the well-known inscription of this city, an
ephor gives his name to the year, five chosen surveyors
(ὁρισταὶ) are to value the sacred lands of Bacchus,
and to measure it according to the rules of Etruscan
<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">agrimensores</span></span>, upon the decree of the public
assembly,<a id="noteref_826" name="noteref_826" href="#note_826"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">826</span></span></a>
in order to ascertain what had been lost in the course
of time, and to secure the remainder. After this, the
state, two polianomi, and the horistæ, let the sacred
land according to a decree of the Heracleans, and state
the conditions; in which certain officers named σιταγερταὶ
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page184">[pg 184]</span><a name="Pg184" id="Pg184" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
are mentioned as inspectors of the public corn-magazine.
The annual polianomi are bound to take
care that the contracts of lease shall be observed; they
carry on inquiries upon this subject jointly with ten
sworn colleagues, elected by the people, in case of any
breach of contract, collect the appointed fines, and
refer, in cases of singular importance, to the public
assembly, they themselves being subject to the responsibility.

16. To these we may add <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Croton</span></span>, since this city,
founded under the authority of Sparta by a Heraclide,
and therefore revering Hercules himself as its founder,<a id="noteref_827" name="noteref_827" href="#note_827"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">827</span></span></a>
must be considered as belonging to the Doric race,
although at a later period the more numerous Achæan
portion of the population appears to have preponderated.
Croton was the soil upon which Pythagoras
endeavoured to realise his notions of a true aristocracy,
an endeavour in which he succeeded. This, however,
we cannot comprehend, unless we consider his ideal
state as no airy project or phantom of the brain, but
rather as founded upon national feelings, and as being
even the foundation of the governments of Sparta,
Crete, and the cities of Lower Italy, in which Pythagoras
first appeared: and for this reason he is described
as in part merely to have restored and
renewed; for example, to have destroyed tyrannies,
quieted the claims of the people, and re-established
ancient rights,<a id="noteref_828" name="noteref_828" href="#note_828"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">828</span></span></a> &amp;c. Croton, however, he selected
as the centre of his operations, as being under the
protection of Apollo, his household god;<a id="noteref_829" name="noteref_829" href="#note_829"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">829</span></span></a> and,
secondly, as being the <span class="tei tei-q">“city of the healthy,”</span> an advantage
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page185">[pg 185]</span><a name="Pg185" id="Pg185" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
which it owed to its climate, to gymnastic
exercises, and to purer morals than were prevalent
at least in the neighbouring cities of Tarentum and
Sybaris. The government of this city was, when the
philosopher came forward, in the hands of the senate
of a thousand,<a id="noteref_830" name="noteref_830" href="#note_830"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">830</span></span></a> which formed a synedrion; the Crotoniats
are reported to have offered to Pythagoras the
presidency of this senate,<a id="noteref_831" name="noteref_831" href="#note_831"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">831</span></span></a> probably as prytanis.<a id="noteref_832" name="noteref_832" href="#note_832"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">832</span></span></a> A
similar senate of a thousand existed at Agrigentum in
the time of Empedocles; the same number of persons,
elected according to their property, were sole governors
at Rhegium.<a id="noteref_833" name="noteref_833" href="#note_833"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">833</span></span></a> This council of a thousand
members also existed at Locri.<a id="noteref_834" name="noteref_834" href="#note_834"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">834</span></span></a> From this we may
infer that the thousand of Croton were the most wealthy
citizens: who in states of which the power is derived
from the possession of land are, before the government
is disturbed by revolutions, generally identical with
the noble families. At Croton they had power to
decide in most affairs without the ratification of the
popular assembly,<a id="noteref_835" name="noteref_835" href="#note_835"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">835</span></span></a> and also possessed a
judicial authority.<a id="noteref_836" name="noteref_836" href="#note_836"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">836</span></span></a>
Now the council instituted by Pythagoras
(which appears not to have been formed of members
elected according to property, but to have been chosen
on purely aristocratical principles) only contained three
hundred members,<a id="noteref_837" name="noteref_837" href="#note_837"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">837</span></span></a> a number which frequently occurs
under similar circumstances;<a id="noteref_838" name="noteref_838" href="#note_838"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">838</span></span></a> at the head of
this council was Pythagoras himself. One of the
most remarkable phenomena in the political history
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page186">[pg 186]</span><a name="Pg186" id="Pg186" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the Greeks is, that the philosophy of order, of unison,
of κόσμος, expressing, and consequently enlisting
on its side, the combined endeavours of the better
part of the people, obtained the management of public
affairs, and held possession of it for a considerable
time; so that the nature and destination of the political
elements in existence being understood, and each
having assigned to it its proper place, those who were
qualified both by their rank and talents were placed at
the head of the state; a strict self-education having in
the first place been made one of their chief obligations
(as it was of the φύλακες of Plato), in order by this
means to prepare the way for the education of the
other members of the community. At present it is
generally acknowledged that the Pythagorean league
was in great part of a political nature, that its object
was to obtain a formal share in the administration of
states, and that its influence upon them was of the
most beneficial kind, which continued for many generations
in Magna Græcia after the dissolution of
the league itself.<a id="noteref_839" name="noteref_839" href="#note_839"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">839</span></span></a> This dissolution was caused by the
natural opposers of an aristocracy of this description,
the popular party and its leaders; for in this character
alone could Cylon have been the author of the
catastrophe which he occasioned; it is recorded, that
the opposition of this order to an agrarian law, which
referred to the division of the territory of the conquered
Sybaris among the people, served to inflame
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page187">[pg 187]</span><a name="Pg187" id="Pg187" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
their minds.<a id="noteref_840" name="noteref_840" href="#note_840"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">840</span></span></a> The opposite party demanded that the
whole people should have admittance to the public
assemblies and to public offices, that all magistrates at
the expiration of their offices should render an account
to a tribunal composed of members elected by lot,<a id="noteref_841" name="noteref_841" href="#note_841"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">841</span></span></a> that all existing debts should be cancelled, and
that the lands should be newly divided:<a id="noteref_842" name="noteref_842" href="#note_842"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">842</span></span></a> from
which we must infer, that the highest officers of the
Pythagoreans were, according to the Spartan and
Cretan principle, irresponsible, and that they considered
election by vote as necessary for all such situations.
How fatal to the quiet of Lower Italy were
the convulsions which followed the destruction of this
league (about 500 B.C.), is proved by the large share
which the whole of Greece took in their pacification.
This was at length effected by the Italian cities entirely
giving up the Doric customs, and adopting an
Achæan government and institutions;<a id="noteref_843" name="noteref_843" href="#note_843"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">843</span></span></a> which they
were afterwards, first by the power of Dionysius of
Syracuse, and then of the neighbouring Barbarians,
compelled to surrender. Now the Achæan constitution,
according to Polybius,<a id="noteref_844" name="noteref_844" href="#note_844"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">844</span></span></a> had become a democracy
immediately after the overthrow of the last king
Ogyges; and retained the same general character,
though some subordinate parts experienced very great
alterations: we also know that it was very unlike the
Spartan government.<a id="noteref_845" name="noteref_845" href="#note_845"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">845</span></span></a> I cannot, however, refrain
from doubting whether it could properly be termed
democracy at so early a period, since Xenophon states,
that in Sicyon, in 368-365 B.C., timocracy was the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page188">[pg 188]</span><a name="Pg188" id="Pg188" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
prevailing form of government, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">according to the
laws of the Achæans</span></span>,”</span><a id="noteref_846" name="noteref_846" href="#note_846"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">846</span></span></a> which words
cannot be referred to a mere transitory condition of that race.
There also was always among the Achæans an equestrian
order (ἱππεῖς), of greater consideration and influence
on the government than can be reconciled with
complete democracy.<a id="noteref_847" name="noteref_847" href="#note_847"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">847</span></span></a> So also at Croton, in the year
of the city 637 (117 B.C.), there was a complete
democracy; but (as in all the cities of the Italian
Greeks at this period) a senate of nobles existed, which
was frequently at open war with the people.<a id="noteref_848" name="noteref_848" href="#note_848"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">848</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
17. Lastly, it is proper to mention the constitution
of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Delphi</span></span>, if our supposition is admitted to be correct,
that the most distinguished Delphian families
were of Doric origin.<a id="noteref_849" name="noteref_849" href="#note_849"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">849</span></span></a> It was also shown
that these families composed at an early period a close aristocracy;
the priests were chosen from among the nobles,
to whom the management of the oracle belonged;
from their body was taken the Pythian court of justice
(which may be compared with the Spartan gerusia,
and the Athenian court of the ephetæ), as well as the
chief magistrates, among whom in early times a king,<a id="noteref_850" name="noteref_850" href="#note_850"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">850</span></span></a>
and afterwards a prytanis, was supreme.<a id="noteref_851" name="noteref_851" href="#note_851"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">851</span></span></a> At a later
period we find mention of archons who gave their name
to the year.<a id="noteref_852" name="noteref_852" href="#note_852"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">852</span></span></a> At the same time a popular party was
formed (perhaps from the subjects of the temple),
which in a later age at least exercised its authority in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page189">[pg 189]</span><a name="Pg189" id="Pg189" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
a public assembly.<a id="noteref_853" name="noteref_853" href="#note_853"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">853</span></span></a> The senate (βουλὴ) of Delphi
was at this period, as in Gela and Rhodes (according
to the hypothesis before advanced), renewed every half
year; but it appears to have consisted of very few
members, for only one senator (βουλεύων), or at most
a few, in addition to the archon, are named in the
donatory decrees of Delphi.<a id="noteref_854" name="noteref_854" href="#note_854"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">854</span></span></a> Many
particulars which belong to a later date we pass over, as our only object
is to point out the characteristic points of the ancient
constitution.

<a name="Book_III_Chapter_IX_Section_18" id="Book_III_Chapter_IX_Section_18" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
18. From these various accounts it follows, that
although there was no one form of government common
to the Doric race in historic times, yet in many
of these states we find a constitution of nearly the
same character, which preceded and caused the subsequent
changes and developments; and was of unequal
duration in different states. This constitution,
which we, with Pindar, consider as most strongly
marked in the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Spartan</span></em> form of government, was of a
strictly aristocratic character;<a id="noteref_855" name="noteref_855" href="#note_855"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">855</span></span></a> hence Sparta was the
basis and corner-stone of the Greek aristocracies, and
in this country alone the nobility ever retained their
original dignity and power. Hence also Sparta, during
the flourishing period of her history, never had a
large number of exiles on political grounds, while in the
other Grecian states the constant revolutions to which
they were subject generally kept one party or other
of the citizens in banishment; nor did she ever experience
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page190">[pg 190]</span><a name="Pg190" id="Pg190" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
any violent disturbances or changes in her
constitution,<a id="noteref_856" name="noteref_856" href="#note_856"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">856</span></span></a> until the number of the genuine Spartans
had nearly become extinct, and the conditions
necessary for the permanence of the ancient government
had in part been removed. Now I call the
Spartan constitution an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">aristocracy</span></em>, without the least
hesitation, on account of its continued and predominant
tendency towards governing the community by a few,
who were presumed to be the best, and as it inculcated
in the citizens far less independent confidence than
obedience and fear of those persons whose worth was
guaranteed by their family, their education, and the
public voice which had called them to the offices of
state. The ancients,<a id="noteref_857" name="noteref_857" href="#note_857"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">857</span></span></a> however, remark, that it might
also be called a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">democracy</span></em>, since the supreme power
was always considered as residing in the people, and
an entire equality of manners prevailed; that it might
be called a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">monarchy</span></em> on account of the
kings;<a id="noteref_858" name="noteref_858" href="#note_858"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">858</span></span></a> and
that in the power of the ephors there was even an
appearance of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tyranny</span></em>: so that in this one constitution
all forms of government were united.<a id="noteref_859" name="noteref_859" href="#note_859"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">859</span></span></a> But the
animating soul of all these forms was the Doric spirit
of fear and respect for ancient and established laws,
and the judgment of older men, the spirit of implicit
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page191">[pg 191]</span><a name="Pg191" id="Pg191" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
obedience towards the state and the constituted authorities
(πειθαρχία);<a id="noteref_860" name="noteref_860" href="#note_860"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">860</span></span></a> and, lastly, the conviction that
strict discipline and a wise restriction of actions are
surer guides to safety, than a superabundance of
strength and activity directed to no certain end.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The relation which, according to these Doric principles,
existed between an inferior and a superior,
between the private citizen and the magistrate, also
extended to the Spartans and other states, as the former
were for a long time considered as aristocrats when
compared with the other Greeks. This superiority
was not caused by external preponderance and compulsion,
but by the internal acknowledgment that strict
laws and a well-ordered discipline belonged to them
above all. It is often curious to remark how great
was the power of a Lacedæmonian cloak and stick
(σκυτάλη καὶ τρίβων, as Plutarch says) among the
other races of the Greeks:<a id="noteref_861" name="noteref_861" href="#note_861"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">861</span></span></a> how, as it were by magic,
the single Gylippus, although by no means the best of
his nation, brings union and stability into the people at
Syracuse, and first gives all their undertakings force
and effect; on more than one occasion a single Spartan
was enough to unite squadrons of Æolians and Ionians
of Asia, and make them act in common; and even at
the times of the dissolution of the Grecian name, we
see Spartans acting as the generals of mercenaries
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page192">[pg 192]</span><a name="Pg192" id="Pg192" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
bound by no other law than the firm and decided will
of their leaders.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Many of the noblest and best of the Athenians
always considered the Spartan state nearly as an ideal
theory realised in practice; and, like Cimon and Xenophon
(whose decided preference for Sparta, though
perhaps sometimes prejudicial to his own country,
must not be called folly), joined themselves to this
state with zeal and eagerness, even to the prejudice of
their own interests. The preference of all the followers
of Socrates for Sparta is well known;<a id="noteref_862" name="noteref_862" href="#note_862"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">862</span></span></a> and Lycurgus,
the most just of financiers, united to an aristocratical
disposition an admiration for the laws of
Lacedæmon.<a id="noteref_863" name="noteref_863" href="#note_863"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">863</span></span></a> It is singular that men of such eminence,
both in a practical and theoretical view, should
express their admiration of a state,<a id="noteref_864" name="noteref_864" href="#note_864"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">864</span></span></a> which modern
writers<a id="noteref_865" name="noteref_865" href="#note_865"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">865</span></span></a> have often represented to us as a horde of half
savages. Nor must the judgment of the persons above
mentioned, who were without doubt sufficiently acquainted
with the object of it, be attributed to a morbid
craving after a state of nature which the Athenians
had for ever lost.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We moderns, on the other hand, on account of our
preconceived notions with respect to the advancement
of civilization, do not read without partiality the lessons
which history affords us; we refuse to recognise the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page193">[pg 193]</span><a name="Pg193" id="Pg193" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
most profound political wisdom in an age which we
believe to have been occupied in rude attempts after
the formation of a settled form of government. Far
otherwise the political speculators of antiquity, such as
the Pythagoreans and Plato, who considered the
Spartan and Cretan form of government, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, the
ancient Dorian, as a general model of all governments;
and, in fact, the ideal constitution which was realized
in Sparta approaches most nearly to that which Pythagoras
attempted to establish in Lower Italy, and
which Plato brought forward as capable of being put
in practice, viz., a close communion, nearly similar to
that of a family, having for its object mutual instruction.
For the regulations of Pythagoras have many
things besides their aristocratic spirit in common with
the Spartan form of government, such as the public
tables, and in general the perpetual living in public,
with the number of laws for the maintenance of public
morality (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">disciplina morum</span></span>); and the community of
goods, which existed among the Pythagoreans, is
nearly allied to the Doric system of equalizing the
landed estates. And Plato, although he at times
criticises the Spartan and Cretan constitution in a
somewhat unfair manner, has evidently derived his
political notions, mediately or immediately, from the
consideration of that form of government:<a id="noteref_866" name="noteref_866" href="#note_866"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">866</span></span></a> for it is
hardly possible that any person should speculate upon
government, without proceeding upon some chosen
historical basis, however he may endeavour to conceal
it. But the Athenian and Ionic democracy he altogether
despises, because that appeared on his principles
to be an annihilation of government rather than a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page194">[pg 194]</span><a name="Pg194" id="Pg194" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
government, in which every person, striving to act as
much as possible for himself, destroyed that unison and
harmony in which each individual exists only as a part
of the whole.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It would be interesting to know what were the
opinions and judgments of Spartans of the better time
concerning these relaxed forms of government. We
may well suppose that they did not view them in a
favourable light. The people of Athens must indeed
have appeared to them in general, as a Lacedæmonian
in Aristophanes<a id="noteref_867" name="noteref_867" href="#note_867"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">867</span></span></a> expresses himself, as a lawless and
turbulent rabble. For this reason they refused in the
Peloponnesian war to negociate with the whole community;
and would only treat with a few selected individuals.<a id="noteref_868" name="noteref_868" href="#note_868"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">868</span></span></a>
Upon the whole, the state of Sparta,
being, in comparison with the general mutability of the
Greeks after the Persian war, like the magnet, which
always pointed to the pole of ancient national customs,
became dissimilar, both in political and domestic
usages, to the rest of Greece;<a id="noteref_869" name="noteref_869" href="#note_869"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">869</span></span></a> and for this reason
the Spartans who were sent into foreign parts either gave
affront by their strangeness and peculiarity, or, by their
want of consistency and firmness, forfeited that confidence
with which they were everywhere met.

1. Having now considered the individuals composing
the state in reference to the supreme governing
power, we will next view them in reference to property,
and investigate the subject of the public
economy. It is evident that this latter must have been
of great simplicity in the Doric states, as it was the
object of their constitution to remove everything accidental
and arbitrary; and by preventing property from
being an object of free choice and individual exertion,
to make it a matter of indifference to persons who were
to be trained only in moral excellence; hence the
dominant class, the genuine Spartans, were almost
entirely interdicted from the labour of trade or agriculture,
and excluded both from the cares and pleasures
of such occupations.<a id="noteref_870" name="noteref_870" href="#note_870"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">870</span></span></a>
Since then upon this principle
it was the object to allow as little freedom as possible
to individuals in the use of property, while the state
gained what these had lost, it is manifest that under a
government of this kind there could not have been any
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page196">[pg 196]</span><a name="Pg196" id="Pg196" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
accurate distinction between public and private economy;
and therefore no attempt will be made to
separate them in the following discussion.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
All land in Laconia was either in the immediate
possession of the state, or freehold property of the
Spartans, or held by the Periœci upon the payment of
a tribute. That there were flocks and lands belonging
to the state of Sparta, is evident from facts which have
been already stated;<a id="noteref_871" name="noteref_871" href="#note_871"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">871</span></span></a> although
perhaps they were not so considerable as in Crete:<a id="noteref_872" name="noteref_872" href="#note_872"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">872</span></span></a> the large forest, in which
every Spartan had a right of hunting, must also have
belonged to the community. There can be no doubt
that this property of the state was different from the
royal lands,<a id="noteref_873" name="noteref_873" href="#note_873"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">873</span></span></a> which were
situated in the territory of the Periœci: it is probable that these (as well as the rest
of that district) were cultivated by the Periœci, who
only paid a tribute to the king. The rest of the territory
of the Periœci was divided into numerous but
small portions, of which, as has been already remarked,
there were 30,000;<a id="noteref_874" name="noteref_874" href="#note_874"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">874</span></span></a> a number which was probably
arranged at the same time with that of the hundred
towns.<a id="noteref_875" name="noteref_875" href="#note_875"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">875</span></span></a> In each lot (κλῆρος) only one family resided,
the members of which subsisted upon its produce, and
cultivated it, to the best of our knowledge, without
the assistance of Helots. For this reason the 9000
lots of the Spartans, which supported twice as many
men as the lots of the
Periœci,<a id="noteref_876" name="noteref_876" href="#note_876"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">876</span></span></a> must upon the whole
have been twice as extensive; each lot must therefore
have been seven times greater. Now the property of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page197">[pg 197]</span><a name="Pg197" id="Pg197" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the Spartans was, according to the united testimony of
all writers, set out in equal lots; probably according
to some general valuation of the produce;<a id="noteref_877" name="noteref_877" href="#note_877"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">877</span></span></a> for the area
could not have been taken as a standard in a country
where the land was of such different degrees of goodness.
Yet even this method of allotment might not
have precluded all inequality: which, on account of
the natural changes of the soil, must in the course of
time have been much augmented; and to this result
the variable number of the slaves, which were strictly
connected with the land, necessarily contributed.
Nevertheless this fact proves that there existed a
principle of equality in the contrivers of the regulation:
for, as we remarked above, this division was in
strictness only a lower degree of a community of
goods, which the Pythagoreans endeavoured to put in
practice, on the principle of the possessions of friends
being common;<a id="noteref_878" name="noteref_878" href="#note_878"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">878</span></span></a> and which actually existed among the
Spartans in the free use of dogs, horses, servants,
and even the furniture of other persons.<a id="noteref_879" name="noteref_879" href="#note_879"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">879</span></span></a> The whole
institution of the public tables in Sparta and Crete
was, indeed, only a means of producing an equal distribution
of property among the members of them.<a id="noteref_880" name="noteref_880" href="#note_880"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">880</span></span></a>

2. Although similar partitions of land had perhaps
been made from the time of the first occupation of
Laconia by the Dorians, the later division into 9000
lots cannot have taken place before the end of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page198">[pg 198]</span><a name="Pg198" id="Pg198" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
first Messenian war.<a id="noteref_881" name="noteref_881" href="#note_881"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">881</span></span></a> There is something very remarkable
in the historical account, that Tyrtæus by
means of his poem of Eunomia repressed the desire
of many citizens for a redivision of the lands.<a id="noteref_882" name="noteref_882" href="#note_882"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">882</span></span></a> It may be explained by supposing that the Spartans,
who before that time had possessed allotments in
Messenia, from which they then obtained no returns,
wished that new estates in Laconia should be assigned
to them.<a id="noteref_883" name="noteref_883" href="#note_883"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">883</span></span></a> At the time, however, of that division
Sparta must in fact have had about 9000 fathers of
families (or, according to the ancient expression, so
many οἶκοι), of which each received a lot; for families
and lots were necessarily connected.<a id="noteref_884" name="noteref_884" href="#note_884"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">884</span></span></a> If then we
suppose that every family of a Spartan was provided
with a lot, the chief object was to keep them together
for the future by proper institutions: and to
ascertain the means which were employed to attain
this end (for they were upon the whole successful) is
a problem which has never yet been satisfactorily
solved.<a id="noteref_885" name="noteref_885" href="#note_885"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">885</span></span></a> The first part was the preservation of families,
in which the legislator was in ancient times assisted
by the sanction of religion. Nothing was more
dreaded by the early Greeks than the extinction of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page199">[pg 199]</span><a name="Pg199" id="Pg199" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the family, and the destruction of the house;<a id="noteref_886" name="noteref_886" href="#note_886"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">886</span></span></a> by which
the dead lost their religious honour, the household
gods their sacrifices, the hearth its flame, and the ancestors
their name among the living. This was in
Sparta provided against by regulations concerning
heiresses, adoptions, introductions of mothaces, and
other means which will presently be mentioned:
those persons also who had not as yet any children
were sometimes spared in war.<a id="noteref_887" name="noteref_887" href="#note_887"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">887</span></span></a> The second means
was the prohibition to alienate or divide the family
allotment,<a id="noteref_888" name="noteref_888" href="#note_888"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">888</span></span></a> which necessarily required the existence of
only one heir,<a id="noteref_889" name="noteref_889" href="#note_889"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">889</span></span></a> who probably was always the eldest
son.<a id="noteref_890" name="noteref_890" href="#note_890"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">890</span></span></a> The extent of his rights, however, was perhaps
no further than that he was considered master of the
house and property; while the other members of the
family had an equal right to a share in the enjoyment
of it. The head of the family was styled in Doric
ἑστιοπάμων, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the lord of the hearth</span></span>;<a id="noteref_891" name="noteref_891" href="#note_891"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">891</span></span></a> the collective
members of the family were called by Epimenides the
Cretan ὁμοκάποι, that is, literally, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">eating from the
same crib</span></span>;<a id="noteref_892" name="noteref_892" href="#note_892"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">892</span></span></a> and by Charondas ὁμοσίπυοι, or <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">living
</span><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page200">[pg 200]</span><a name="Pg200" id="Pg200" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style="font-style: italic">
upon the same stock</span></span>;”</span><a id="noteref_893" name="noteref_893" href="#note_893"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">893</span></span></a> and by the
Spartans perhaps παῶται.<a id="noteref_894" name="noteref_894" href="#note_894"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">894</span></span></a> The master of the family was therefore
obliged to contribute for all these to the syssitia,
without which contribution no one was admitted;<a id="noteref_895" name="noteref_895" href="#note_895"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">895</span></span></a> we
shall see presently that he was able to provide this
contribution for three men and women besides himself;
the other expenses were inconsiderable.<a id="noteref_896" name="noteref_896" href="#note_896"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">896</span></span></a> If,
however, the family contained more than three men,
which must frequently have been the case, the means
adopted for relieving the excessive number were either
to marry them with heiresses, or to send them out as
colonists; or the state had recourse to some other
means of preventing absolute want. This would have
been effected with the greater ease, if it were true, as
Plutarch relates, that immediately after the birth of
every Spartan boy, the eldest of the tribe, sitting
together in a lesche, gave him one of the 9000 lots.<a id="noteref_897" name="noteref_897" href="#note_897"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">897</span></span></a>
For this, however, it must be assumed that the state
or the tribes had possession of some lots, of those perhaps
in which the families had become extinct; but
we know that these lots went in a regular succession
to other families,<a id="noteref_898" name="noteref_898" href="#note_898"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">898</span></span></a> by which means many became exceedingly
rich. These elders of the tribe, mentioned
by Plutarch, were therefore probably only the eldest
of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">house</span></em> or γένος, who might take care that, if
several sons and at the same time several lots had
fallen together in one family, the younger sons should,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page201">[pg 201]</span><a name="Pg201" id="Pg201" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
as far as was possible, be in the possession of land,
without however violating the indivisible unity of an
allotment.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In this manner at Sparta the family, together with
the estate, formed an undivided whole, under the control
of one head, who was privileged by his birth.
But if the number of persons to be fed was too great,
as compared with the means of feeding them, the
natural consequence was, that the privileged eldest
brother could afford to marry, while the younger
brothers remained without wives or children. This
natural inference from the above account is strikingly
confirmed by a most singular statement of Polybius,<a id="noteref_899" name="noteref_899" href="#note_899"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">899</span></span></a>
which has lately been brought to light, viz., that <span class="tei tei-q">“in
Sparta several brothers had often one wife, and that
the children were brought up in common.”</span> If we
may here infer a misrepresentation, to which the Spartan
institutions were particularly liable, it is seen how
the custom just described might cause <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">several</span></em> men to
dwell in one house, upon the same estate, of whom
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em> only had a wife. But it must be confessed that
the Spartan institution was very likely to lead to the
terrible abuse which Polybius mentions, particularly
as the Spartan laws, as we shall see presently,<a id="noteref_900" name="noteref_900" href="#note_900"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">900</span></span></a> did
not absolutely prohibit the husband from allowing the
procreation of children from his wife by strangers.
It is therefore possible that the Hebrew institution of
the Levirate-marriage (viz., that if a man died without
leaving children, his widow became the wife of
her former husband's brother, who was to raise up
seed to his brother)<a id="noteref_901" name="noteref_901" href="#note_901"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">901</span></span></a> was extended in Sparta to the
lifetime of the childless elder brother.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page202">[pg 202]</span><a name="Pg202" id="Pg202" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<a name="Book_III_Chapter_X_Section_3" id="Book_III_Chapter_X_Section_3" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
3. This whole system was entirely broken up by
the law of the ephor Epitadeus, which permitted any
person to give away his house and lot during his lifetime,
and also to leave it as he chose by will.<a id="noteref_902" name="noteref_902" href="#note_902"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">902</span></span></a>
Whence, as might have been expected, the practice
of legacy-hunting rose to a great height, in which the
rich had always the advantage over the poor. This
law, which was directly opposed to the spirit of the
Spartan constitution, was passed after the time of Lysander,
but a considerable period before Aristotle;
since this writer, manifestly confounding the state of
things as it existed in his time with the ancient legislation,<a id="noteref_903" name="noteref_903" href="#note_903"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">903</span></span></a>
reckons it as an inconsistency in the constitution
of Sparta, that buying and selling of property
was attended with dishonour,<a id="noteref_904" name="noteref_904" href="#note_904"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">904</span></span></a> but that it was permitted
to give it away, and bequeath it by will.<a id="noteref_905" name="noteref_905" href="#note_905"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">905</span></span></a>
From that time we find that the number of the Spartans,
and particularly of the landed proprietors, continually
decreased. The first fact is very remarkable,
and can hardly be accounted for by the wars,<a id="noteref_906" name="noteref_906" href="#note_906"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">906</span></span></a> in which
moreover the Spartans lost but few of their number;
it was perhaps rather owing to the late marriages,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page203">[pg 203]</span><a name="Pg203" id="Pg203" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
which also frequently took place between members of
the same family. After all, it must be confessed that
the constitution of Sparta too much restrained the
natural inclination of the citizens; and by making
every thing too subservient to public ends, checked
the free growth of the people, and, like a plant
trimmed by an unsparing hand, destroyed its means
both of actual strength and future increase. At the
time of Aristotle they endeavoured to increase the
population by exempting the father of three sons from
serving in war, and the father of four sons from all
taxes.<a id="noteref_907" name="noteref_907" href="#note_907"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">907</span></span></a> But even Herodotus only reckons 8000
Spartans in the 9000 families; in the middle of the
Peloponnesian war Sparta did not send quite 6000
heavy-armed soldiers into the field.<a id="noteref_908" name="noteref_908" href="#note_908"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">908</span></span></a> Aristotle states
that in his time the whole of Laconia could hardly
furnish 1000 heavy-armed men;<a id="noteref_909" name="noteref_909" href="#note_909"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">909</span></span></a> and at the time of
Agis the Third there were only 700 genuine Spartans.<a id="noteref_910" name="noteref_910" href="#note_910"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">910</span></span></a>
Even in 399 B.C. the Spartans who were in
possession of lots<a id="noteref_911" name="noteref_911" href="#note_911"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">911</span></span></a> did not compose a large number in
comparison with the people; for the numerous Neodamodes
must not be included among them, who it
appears could not obtain lots in any other manner
than by adoption into a Spartan family, before which
time they were provided for by the state. We are
entirely uninformed in what manner the loss of Messenia
was borne by Sparta; it cannot be supposed
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page204">[pg 204]</span><a name="Pg204" id="Pg204" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that whole families completely lost their landed property;
for they would have perished by famine. No
writer has, however, preserved a trace of the mode
in which these difficulties were met by the state. At
the time of Agis the Third we know that of the 700
Spartans, about 100 only were in possession of the
district of the city.<a id="noteref_912" name="noteref_912" href="#note_912"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">912</span></span></a>

4. From this view of the times, which succeeded
the innovation of Epitadeus, we will now turn to the
original system, which indeed we are scarcely able to
ascertain, from the feeble and obscure indications now
extant. In the first place, we know with certainty
that daughters had originally no dowry (in Doric
δωτίνη),<a id="noteref_913" name="noteref_913" href="#note_913"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">913</span></span></a> and were married with a gift of clothes,
&amp;c.;<a id="noteref_914" name="noteref_914" href="#note_914"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">914</span></span></a> afterwards, however, they were at least provided
with money and other moveable property.<a id="noteref_915" name="noteref_915" href="#note_915"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">915</span></span></a> At
the time of Aristotle, after the ephoralty of Epitadeus,
they were also endowed with land.<a id="noteref_916" name="noteref_916" href="#note_916"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">916</span></span></a> This was the
regulation in case of the existence of a son; if there
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page205">[pg 205]</span><a name="Pg205" id="Pg205" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
was none, the daughter, and if there were several
daughters, probably the eldest, became heiress (ἐπίκληρος,
in Doric ἐπιπαματίς);<a id="noteref_917" name="noteref_917" href="#note_917"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">917</span></span></a> that is to say, the
possession of her was necessarily connected with that
of the inheritance. Regulations concerning heiresses
were an object of chief importance in the ancient
legislations, on account of their anxiety for the maintenance
of families, as in that of Androdamas of Rhegium
for the Thracian Chalcideans,<a id="noteref_918" name="noteref_918" href="#note_918"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">918</span></span></a> and in the
code of Solon,<a id="noteref_919" name="noteref_919" href="#note_919"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">919</span></span></a> with which the Chalcidean laws of Charondas
appear to have agreed in all essential points.<a id="noteref_920" name="noteref_920" href="#note_920"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">920</span></span></a>
We will mention the most important of these regulations.
The heiress, together with her inheritance,
belonged to the kinsmen of the family (ἀγχιστεῖς);
so that in early times<a id="noteref_921" name="noteref_921" href="#note_921"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">921</span></span></a> the father could not dispose of
his daughter as he liked without their assent. But,
according to the later Athenian law, the father had
power either during his life or by will to give his
daughter, with her inheritance, in marriage to whomever
he wished. If, however, this power was not
exercised, the kinsmen had a right of claiming the
daughter by a judicial process; and the right to
marry her went round in a regular succession.<a id="noteref_922" name="noteref_922" href="#note_922"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">922</span></span></a> But
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page206">[pg 206]</span><a name="Pg206" id="Pg206" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the unmarried man, to whom of all her kinsmen she
was allotted, was not only privileged, but also compelled
to marry her.<a id="noteref_923" name="noteref_923" href="#note_923"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">923</span></span></a> The laws also exercised a further
superintendence over him, and enjoined that he
should beget children from his wife,<a id="noteref_924" name="noteref_924" href="#note_924"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">924</span></span></a> which
then did not pass into his family, but into that of his wife, and
became the successors of their maternal grandfather.
Now there is no doubt that in Sparta the family was
continued by means of the heiresses; but it is probable
that they always chose for their husbands persons
who had no lots of their own, such as the descendants
of younger brothers, and, first, persons of
the same family,<a id="noteref_925" name="noteref_925" href="#note_925"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">925</span></span></a> if there were any, then persons
connected by relationship, and so on. If the father
himself had made no disposition concerning his
daughters, (in which respect, however, his choice
was limited,) it was to be decided by the king's court
who among the privileged persons should marry the
heiress.<a id="noteref_926" name="noteref_926" href="#note_926"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">926</span></span></a> It was not until after the time of
Epitadeus that the father could betroth his daughter to whom
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page207">[pg 207]</span><a name="Pg207" id="Pg207" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
he pleased; and if he had not declared his intention,
his heir had equal right to decide concerning her.<a id="noteref_927" name="noteref_927" href="#note_927"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">927</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If, however, the family was without female issue,
and the succession had not been secured during the
father's lifetime by adoption in the presence of the
king, it is probable that the heads of houses related to
the surviving daughter married her to a son of their
own, who was then considered as successor of the
family into which he was introduced—a means employed
at Athens,<a id="noteref_928" name="noteref_928" href="#note_928"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">928</span></span></a> and probably therefore at Sparta
also, for preventing the extinction of families. But
there were two customs peculiar to the Lacedæmonians;
in the first place, a husband, if he considered
that the unfruitfulness of the marriage was owing to
himself (for if he considered his wife as barren he had
power immediately to put her away),<a id="noteref_929" name="noteref_929" href="#note_929"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">929</span></span></a> gave
his matrimonial rights to a younger and more powerful man,
whose child then belonged to the family of the husband,
although it was also publicly considered as related
to the family of the real father.<a id="noteref_930" name="noteref_930" href="#note_930"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">930</span></span></a> The second
institution was, that to the wives of men, who, for example,
had fallen in war before they had begotten any
children, other men (probably slaves) were assigned,
in order to produce heirs and successors, not to themselves,
but to the deceased husband.<a id="noteref_931" name="noteref_931" href="#note_931"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">931</span></span></a> Both these
customs, which appear to us so singular (though similar
regulations existed in the constitution of Solon),
originated from the superstitious dread of the destruction
of a family. When this motive lost its power
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page208">[pg 208]</span><a name="Pg208" id="Pg208" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
upon the mind, these ancient institutions were probably
also lost, and the population and number of families
were continually diminished.

5. In Sparta, however, the principle of community
of goods was carried to a further extent than in any
other nation, although it was the principle on which
the legislation of many other Grecian states was
founded. Phaleas the Chalcedonian had made it the
basis of his laws.<a id="noteref_932" name="noteref_932" href="#note_932"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">932</span></span></a> The prohibition of Solon, that no

cases, however, in which the restoration or introduction of equality
was not possible, the legislators endeavoured to make
the landed estates inalienable. For this reason the mortgaging of
land was prohibited in Elis;<a id="noteref_934" name="noteref_934" href="#note_934"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">934</span></span></a> and

but endeavoured to restore the original equality from
time to time, perhaps in a manner similar to the jubilee-year
of the Hebrews:<a id="noteref_940" name="noteref_940" href="#note_940"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">940</span></span></a> this was in fact most simply
effected by the Illyrian Dalmatians, who made a new
division of the tillage-land every seven years.<a id="noteref_941" name="noteref_941" href="#note_941"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">941</span></span></a> If the
Doric legislation of Crete had originally a tendency of
this kind, its adoption in practice had evidently been
hindered by peculiar circumstances. For Polybius<a id="noteref_942" name="noteref_942" href="#note_942"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">942</span></span></a>
at least knew of no Cretan laws which laid any restriction
upon the purchase of land, nor indeed upon gain
in general:<a id="noteref_943" name="noteref_943" href="#note_943"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">943</span></span></a> the landed estates were divided among
the brothers, the sisters receiving half a brother's
share.<a id="noteref_944" name="noteref_944" href="#note_944"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">944</span></span></a>
In this manner, in the narration of Ulysses,<a id="noteref_945" name="noteref_945" href="#note_945"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">945</span></span></a>
the sons of Castor, the son of Hylacus, made a division
of their patrimony; the illegitimate son receiving only
a small share (νοθεῖα). But the poor frequently, by
marriage with wealthy wives, attained to riches, together
with personal distinction. In addition to this,
privateering expeditions, sometimes as far as Egypt,
for which individual adventurers frequently equipped
whole flotillas, gave an opportunity for a more rapid
acquisition of wealth. This habit of living in ships,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page210">[pg 210]</span><a name="Pg210" id="Pg210" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and at the same time the variable condition of the
different states, necessarily produced a frequent change
of property, and soon put an end to all firmness and
equality wherever they existed.

6. But the Cretan institution of the syssitia was,
at least according to the judgment of Aristotle,
founded more upon the principle of community of
goods than the same establishment in Sparta, since in
the former country the expenses of it were defrayed
by the state, and not by the contributions of the citizens.<a id="noteref_946" name="noteref_946" href="#note_946"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">946</span></span></a>
This institution of the ancient Dorians, or
rather of the ancient Greeks in general, we will consider
in a subsequent part of this work, with reference
to manners and taste; here it must be viewed as
affecting the public economy. In Sparta every member
of the phiditia contributed to them, as has been
already stated, from his own stock;<a id="noteref_947" name="noteref_947" href="#note_947"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">947</span></span></a> the amount required
was about one Attic medimnus and a half of
barley-meal, eleven or twelve choëis of wine,<a id="noteref_948" name="noteref_948" href="#note_948"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">948</span></span></a> five
minas of cheese, with half the same quantity of figs,
together with dates,<a id="noteref_949" name="noteref_949" href="#note_949"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">949</span></span></a> and ten Æginetan oboli for
meat.<a id="noteref_950" name="noteref_950" href="#note_950"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">950</span></span></a>
The approximate statement of one Attic medimnus
and a half is probably meant as an equivalent to one
Æginetan medimnus;<a id="noteref_951" name="noteref_951" href="#note_951"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">951</span></span></a> the ten oboli are equal to a
Corinthian stater, or a Syracusan decalitre; the whole
is doubtless the monthly contribution of an individual,<a id="noteref_952" name="noteref_952" href="#note_952"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">952</span></span></a>
and is amply sufficient for the consumption of one
person. For the daily allowance being elsewhere
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page211">[pg 211]</span><a name="Pg211" id="Pg211" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
reckoned at two chœnices, and one cotyla of wine
(although the latter is an extremely small quantity),<a id="noteref_953" name="noteref_953" href="#note_953"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">953</span></span></a> this contribution would give rather more than two
chœnices, and five cotylas for each day. There appears
to have been only a small allowance for meat,
but the want of it was partly supplied by the frequent
sacrifices, and partly by the excellent institution of the
ἐπάϊκλα, which were additions to the regular meal or
αἶκλον. The poorer members of the syssition furnished
these from the proceeds of the chase, while
wealthier persons supplied wheaten bread (the common
provision being barley cakes, μᾶζαι), with young
cattle from their flocks, birds prepared as ματτύα,
and the fruits of the season from their lands.<a id="noteref_954" name="noteref_954" href="#note_954"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">954</span></span></a> Voluntary
gifts of this kind were probably seldom wanting,
so long as the spirit of community influenced their
minds; it was also natural that they should contribute
largely, in order to give variety and grace to their
otherwise uniform banquet.

7. In the Cretan institution, however, the state provided
for all the citizens and their wives.<a id="noteref_955" name="noteref_955" href="#note_955"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">955</span></span></a> The revenues
received by the community from the public lands,
and from the tributes of the Periœci, were divided
according to the months of the year into twelve parts;<a id="noteref_956" name="noteref_956" href="#note_956"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">956</span></span></a>
and also into two according to the purpose to which it
was appropriated; so that one half defrayed the sacrifices
and the expenses of the government, the other
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page212">[pg 212]</span><a name="Pg212" id="Pg212" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
went to the public banquets.<a id="noteref_957" name="noteref_957" href="#note_957"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">957</span></span></a> Now this
latter half was divided among the different families, and each gave
his share into the company of syssitia (ἑταιρία) to
which he belonged.<a id="noteref_958" name="noteref_958" href="#note_958"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">958</span></span></a> It may be asked why the state
did not allot these sums directly among the syssitia,
instead of making the payment indirectly through the
members: it is, however, probable that these companies
were formed at will by the several messmates.
The division of the public revenue is in some measure
similar to the proceeding of the Athenians with respect
to the Laurian silver-mines.<a id="noteref_959" name="noteref_959" href="#note_959"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">959</span></span></a> In addition to
this, every citizen furnished a tenth of the produce of
his lands, and every Clarotes an Æginetan stater for
his master.<a id="noteref_960" name="noteref_960" href="#note_960"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">960</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Although the meaning and object of this institution
is quite intelligible, it is not easy to obtain a clear
notion of the Lacedæmonian system. The produce
of a lot amounted for the Spartans, according to a
passage above quoted, to 82 medimni. If we suppose
these to be Attic medimni, as was there assumed upon
a mere approximate calculation, each lot would have
enabled three men to contribute to the syssitia (54
medimni), and would also have furnished a scanty
subsistence at home to three women. But this would
leave a surplus, in addition to whatever money was
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page213">[pg 213]</span><a name="Pg213" id="Pg213" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
required as a subscription to the syssitia, for all other
household expenses. Now it is true that among the
poorer citizens these could not have been considerable,
since the younger children went with their fathers to
the public tables, and the elder were educated and
maintained by the state; to which might be added the
produce of the chase, and the charity of other persons.
But after making all allowance for these causes, the
expenses for dwellings, clothing, furniture, and partly
for food not provided by the syssitia, still remain undefrayed.
It is, however, evident that there would have
been sufficient income to meet these demands, if we
suppose that the 82 medimni were not Attic, but
Æginetan, which were considerably larger.<a id="noteref_961" name="noteref_961" href="#note_961"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">961</span></span></a> But
even upon this supposition one lot could not have
maintained more than six persons, unless the rent of
the Helots is assumed higher: and it might also be the
case (which however, according to Aristotle, appears
to have been of rare occurrence), that they were not
able to pay their contributions.

8. Of the domestic economy of Lacedæmon we
have little knowledge; although Aristotle, or rather
Theophrastus (who is now known to be the author of
the first book of the Economics), gives it a separate
place in treating of this subject. Every master of a
family, if he received his share of the produce of the

and sold the rest in the market of Sparta:<a id="noteref_962" name="noteref_962" href="#note_962"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">962</span></span></a> the

granaries (ταμιεῖα) upon their estates, which, according
to ancient custom, they kept under a seal; it was
however permitted to any poor person, who for example
had remained too long in the chase, to open the
granary, take out what he wanted, and then put his
own seal, his iron ring, upon the door.<a id="noteref_966" name="noteref_966" href="#note_966"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">966</span></span></a>

9. In the market of Sparta, money was employed
more often as a medium of comparison than of exchange;
small coins were chiefly used, and no value
was attributed to the possession of large quantities.<a id="noteref_967" name="noteref_967" href="#note_967"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">967</span></span></a>
This usage Lycurgus had established, by permitting
only the use of iron coin, which had been made useless
for common purposes, by cooling in vinegar, or by
some other process.<a id="noteref_968" name="noteref_968" href="#note_968"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">968</span></span></a> In early times iron spits or bars

of Phidon the Argive were replaced by coined metal.
The chief coin was called from its shape, and perhaps
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page215">[pg 215]</span><a name="Pg215" id="Pg215" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
also from its size, πέλανορ, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the cake used in sacrifices</span></span>;
its value was equal to four chalcûs, that is, to a half
obolus, or the twelfth of a drachma<a id="noteref_970" name="noteref_970" href="#note_970"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">970</span></span></a> (manifestly of the
Æginetan standard, as the Spartan coinage must
necessarily have been adapted to this measure), and
weighed an Æginetan mina.<a id="noteref_971" name="noteref_971" href="#note_971"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">971</span></span></a> Now as a mina of silver
contained 1200 half oboli, the price of silver must have
been to that of iron as 1200 to one; an excessive
cheapness of the latter metal, which can only be explained
by the large quantity of iron found in Laconia,
and the high price of silver in early times. Ten
Æginetan minas of money were, according to this
calculation, equal in weight to 1200 minas, and it is
easy to see that it would have required large carriages for
transport, and an extensive space when kept in
store.<a id="noteref_972" name="noteref_972" href="#note_972"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">972</span></span></a>

10. That, however, the possession of gold and silver
money was expressly interdicted to the citizens of
Sparta, is abundantly proved by the prohibition renewed
at the time of Lysander by Sciraphidas or
Phlogidas:<a id="noteref_973" name="noteref_973" href="#note_973"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">973</span></span></a> and how strong was the hold of this
ancient custom is seen from the punishment of death
which was threatened to those who secretly transgressed
it. The possession of wrought precious metals does
not appear to have been illegal. This decree, however,
expressly permitted to the state the possession of gold
and silver:<a id="noteref_974" name="noteref_974" href="#note_974"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">974</span></span></a> which enactment was also doubtless a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page216">[pg 216]</span><a name="Pg216" id="Pg216" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
restoration of ancient custom. Without the possession
of a coin of general currency, Sparta would have been
unable to send ambassadors to foreign states, to maintain
troops in another country, or to take foreign, for
instance Cretan, mercenaries into pay. We also know
that the Lacedæmonians sent sacred offerings to
Delphi, as for example, the golden stars of the Dioscuri
dedicated by Lysander;<a id="noteref_975" name="noteref_975" href="#note_975"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">975</span></span></a> and Lacedæmonian artists
made for the state statues of gold and ivory.<a id="noteref_976" name="noteref_976" href="#note_976"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">976</span></span></a> This
took place about the time of the Persian war. A
century indeed earlier, Sparta had not enough gold to
gild the face of the statue of Apollo at Thornax, and
endeavoured to buy it in Lydia, probably in exchange
for silver.<a id="noteref_977" name="noteref_977" href="#note_977"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">977</span></span></a> It follows from this, that in Sparta the
state was sole possessor of the precious metals, at
least in the shape of coin (though it did not coin any
money of its own before the time of Alexander),<a id="noteref_978" name="noteref_978" href="#note_978"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">978</span></span></a>
which it used in the intercourse with foreign nations.
The individual citizens however, who were without
the pale of this intercourse, only required and possessed
iron coin;<a id="noteref_979" name="noteref_979" href="#note_979"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">979</span></span></a> in a manner precisely similar to that
proposed by Plato in the Laws, viz., that the money
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page217">[pg 217]</span><a name="Pg217" id="Pg217" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
generally current should be at the disposal of the state,
and should be given out by the magistrates for the
purposes of war and foreign travel, and that within the
country should be circulated a coinage in itself worthless,
deriving its value from public ordinance.<a id="noteref_980" name="noteref_980" href="#note_980"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">980</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Still however, some difficult questions remain to be
considered. In the first place, it is evident that whatever
commerce was carried on by Laconia,<a id="noteref_981" name="noteref_981" href="#note_981"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">981</span></span></a> could not
have existed without a coinage of universal currency.
Now it is impossible that this trade could have been
carried on by the state, since it would have required a
proportionate number of public officers; consequently
it was in the hands of the Periœci. We must therefore
suppose that the possession of silver coin was
allowed to this class of persons; in general, indeed the
Spartan customs did not without exception extend to
the Periœci. Nor could this have had much influence
upon the Spartans, since they had not any personal
connexion with the Periœci, the latter being
only tributary to the state. In the market of Sparta
in which the Spartans and Helots sold their corn and
the products of native industry were exposed, all
foreigners being entirely excluded,<a id="noteref_982" name="noteref_982" href="#note_982"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">982</span></span></a> doubtless none but
the iron coin was used; and so also in the whole of
Laconia it was current at its fixed value; but those
Lacedæmonians who were not of Doric origin must
have possessed a currency of their own, probably under
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page218">[pg 218]</span><a name="Pg218" id="Pg218" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
certain restrictions. And the tributes of these persons
were doubtless the chief source from which the state
derived its silver and gold coins. Besides this, the
kings must also have been privileged to possess silver
and gold. If some permission of this kind had not
existed, Pausanias (who was in strictness only guardian
of the king) would not have been able to receive among other
spoils ten talents from the plunder of Platæa;<a id="noteref_983" name="noteref_983" href="#note_983"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">983</span></span></a>
and Pleistonax and Agis the First could not have been
fined in the sums of fifteen talents, and 100,000
drachmas:<a id="noteref_984" name="noteref_984" href="#note_984"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">984</span></span></a> at a later time also, as has been already
remarked, Agis the Third was possessed of six hundred
talents.<a id="noteref_985" name="noteref_985" href="#note_985"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">985</span></span></a> The estates of the kings were also situated
in the territory of the Periœci, in which silver money
was in circulation, and it is at least possible that the
payments may have been made to them in this coinage.
Herodotus states that every king at the beginning
of his reign remitted all the debts of the citizens both
to the state and to the kings:<a id="noteref_986" name="noteref_986" href="#note_986"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">986</span></span></a> they therefore cancelled
all certificates of debt, which in Sparta were called
κλάρια, or mortgages, probably because the land (and
in early times the produce of the land only) was assigned
as security.<a id="noteref_987" name="noteref_987" href="#note_987"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">987</span></span></a> This was a wise institution, by
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page219">[pg 219]</span><a name="Pg219" id="Pg219" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
which those persons in particular were relieved who
had, for a particular object, received from the kings
or the state, gold or silver, which on account of the
small value of the iron coinage they were seldom able
to repay. Now gold and silver were, for example,
necessary to all persons who had to undertake a
journey out of Laconia, and these they could not obtain
otherwise than from the magistrates or the king,<a id="noteref_988" name="noteref_988" href="#note_988"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">988</span></span></a>

the way of foreign travel.

11. It is, however, well known that in this respect
the ancient severity of custom was gradually relaxed.
Even in the third generation before the Persian war,
the just Glaucus was tempted to defraud a Milesian of
a sum of money deposited with him. The Persian
war only increased the public wealth, and the Persian
subsidies were confined to the payment of national expenses.

of money into Sparta, and made this state the most

have maintained the same proud indigence. But was
it possible for individuals to despise what the state
esteemed so highly, and would they not naturally endeavour
to found their fame upon that on which the
power of the nation depended? Even Lysander, who,
with all the artfulness and versatility of his manners,
had a considerable severity of character, was still unwilling
to enrich himself;<a id="noteref_990" name="noteref_990" href="#note_990"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">990</span></span></a>

system was arranged in a peculiar manner, for the
convenience of intercourse with the natives; and as
this subject is of much importance in a historical point

a complete investigation. If we consider
the names of the coins in use among the Dorians of
Italy and Sicily, for example, at Syracuse and Tarentum
(as they had been collected by Aristotle in his
Constitution of the Himeræans from Doric Poets),<a id="noteref_1009" name="noteref_1009" href="#note_1009"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1009</span></span></a>

ὀγχία for a twelfth; it is at once evident that these
Greeks had adopted the Italian and Roman duodenary
system, in which the libra, the pound of brass, was the
unit;<a id="noteref_1011" name="noteref_1011" href="#note_1011"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1011</span></span></a> a system which was originally unknown to the
Greeks, and accordingly the word λίτρα has no root
in their language. Now, together with these coins in
the Greek states, the νόμος,<a id="noteref_1012" name="noteref_1012" href="#note_1012"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1012</span></span></a> among the Latins
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">numus</span></span>,
occurs; manifestly, as Varro says, a word belonging
to the former people, and signifying a coin current by
law; whence it is evident that the Italians, in the regulations
of their monetary system, did not merely give
to the Greeks of Italy, but that they also received
something in return, and that one standard was compounded,
partaking in some measure of both methods
of computation. If we, then, consider the form and
value of these coins, it is plain that the Greek colonies
retained the system of money which they brought
with them from Peloponnesus; and that they did not
till subsequently adapt their coinage to the native
standard. They then made the litra equal to the
obolus, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, to the Æginetan, which was also the
Corinthian;<a id="noteref_1013" name="noteref_1013" href="#note_1013"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1013</span></span></a> so that a Corinthian stater of ten oboli
was called in Syracuse a δεχάλιτρον, or piece of ten
litras. At the time, therefore, when this system was
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page225">[pg 225]</span><a name="Pg225" id="Pg225" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
formed, the lb. of copper must have really been equal
in value to a silver obolus. Now since the former
weighed 6048,<a id="noteref_1014" name="noteref_1014" href="#note_1014"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1014</span></span></a> the latter nearly 23 French grains,<a id="noteref_1015" name="noteref_1015" href="#note_1015"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1015</span></span></a>
the ratio of silver to copper must at the time of this
arrangement have been as 1 to 263; the commerce of
these regions having in early times determined this
proportion. But as more silver was gradually introduced
by the trade with the west of Europe, and probably
at the same time some native copper-mines were
exhausted, copper, which was the circulating medium
of Italy, rose in comparison with silver, the circulating
medium of Greece; and this was the principal cause
of the constant diminution in the weight of the as in
Etruria and Rome. But a detailed examination of
this subject, so important in the history of the commerce
of Greece and Italy, does not fall within the
plan of the present work.<a id="noteref_1016" name="noteref_1016" href="#note_1016"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1016</span></span></a>

on any litras or oboli of Tarentum; and, secondly,

so small a coin of silver, always made use of the
simplest devices. If, however, the Tarentine numus

to 60 lbs. of copper, which was the same number of
minas that the Æginetan talent of silver contained.

1. The law, as well as the economy, of the Dorians,
seems to bear a character of very great antiquity, as
far as our scanty means of information permit us to
judge. It exhibits strong marks of the early time at
which it originated, and it is impossible not to recognise
in it a certain loftiness and severity of character. For
this reason it was ill suited to the circumstances of the
more unrestrained and active manners of later times,
and only owed its continuance to the isolated situation
in which Sparta succeeded in keeping herself.
Thus the civil law was less definite and settled here
than in any other part of Greece in early times, as
property was, according to the Spartan notions, to be
looked upon as a matter of indifference; in the decrees
and institutions attributed to Lycurgus, no mention
was made of this point, and the ephors were
permitted to judge according to their own notions of
equity. The ancient legislators had an evident repugnance
to any strict regulations on this subject;
thus Zaleucus, who, however, first made particular enactments concerning
the right of property,<a id="noteref_1023" name="noteref_1023" href="#note_1023"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1023</span></span></a> expressly
interdicted certificates of debt.<a id="noteref_1024" name="noteref_1024" href="#note_1024"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1024</span></span></a> The laws of
that early period had a much more personal tendency,
and rather regulated the actions of every individual by
means of the national customs. It was nearly indifferent
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page228">[pg 228]</span><a name="Pg228" id="Pg228" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
whether those actions immediately concerned
other persons or not; the whole state was considered
as injured and attacked when any individual did not
comply with the general principles. Hence the
ancient courts of justice exercised a superintendence
over the manners of the citizens, as, for instance, the
Areopagus at Athens, and the Gerusia at Sparta:
hence the extensive interference of the law with the
most private relations, such, for example, as marriage.
But the history of nations is a history of the progress
of individual liberty; among the Greeks of later times
the laws necessarily lost this binding force, and obtained
a negative character, by which they only so far
restrained the actions of each individual, as was necessary
for the co-existence of other members of the state.
In Sparta, however, law and custom retained nearly
equal power; it will therefore be impossible to treat
of them separately, and we must be satisfied with
some observations upon the judicial system in Sparta
and other Doric states.

At Sparta, as well as at Athens, the parties interested
were, of course, entitled to accuse in private
causes; and in criminal cases the next of kin; it
cannot however be supposed that in Sparta, as in
Athens, every citizen of the state was empowered to
institute a public action; as a regulation of this kind
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page230">[pg 230]</span><a name="Pg230" id="Pg230" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
appears too inseparably connected with democracy.
Private individuals were therefore only permitted to
lay an information before a magistrate, which was also

as we find to have been so frequently the case with
the ephors, by some public officer. In the judicial
procedure of Sparta, it is probable that much of the
ancient Grecian simplicity remained, which Aristotle
for example remarks in the criminal proceedings of
the Æolic Cume, where in trials for murder witnesses
from the family of the murdered person were sufficient
to prove the offence.<a id="noteref_1033" name="noteref_1033" href="#note_1033"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1033</span></span></a> In the ancient laws of Rhadamanthus,

The laws by which the decisions were regulated
were supposed to live in the breasts of the magistrates
themselves; nor was there any written law during the
flourishing times of Sparta. The interpreters of the

3. Among the various punishments which occur,
fines levied on property would appear ridiculous in
any other state than Sparta on account of their extreme
lowness. Perseus in his treatise on the Lacedæmonian
government, says, that <span class="tei tei-q">“the judge immediately
condemns the rich man to the loss of a
dessert (ἐπάïκλον); the poor he orders to bring a
reed, or a rush, or laurel-leaves for the public banquet.”</span>
Nicocles the Lacedæmonian says, upon the
same subject, <span class="tei tei-q">“when the ephor has heard all the
witnesses, he either acquits the defendant or condemns
him: and the successful plaintiff slightly
fines him in a cake, or some laurel-leaves,”</span> which
were used to give a relish to the cakes.<a id="noteref_1040" name="noteref_1040" href="#note_1040"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1040</span></span></a> From this
it is evident that actions were heard before the ephors,
and probably in private cases, in which the plaintiff
assessed the fine (ἀγῶνες τιμητοὶ). Large fines of
money in early times only occur as being paid by the
kings, but afterwards by generals, harmosts, &amp;c.<a id="noteref_1041" name="noteref_1041" href="#note_1041"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1041</span></span></a>
The defendant was frequently condemned to leave the
country.<a id="noteref_1042" name="noteref_1042" href="#note_1042"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1042</span></span></a> It is hardly possible that a complete confiscation
of property, extending to land, could have been
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page232">[pg 232]</span><a name="Pg232" id="Pg232" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
permitted in Sparta,<a id="noteref_1043" name="noteref_1043" href="#note_1043"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1043</span></span></a> although it is mentioned in
Argos and Phlius. Imprisonment was never employed
in Sparta as a penalty for a free citizen, but
only as a means of preventing the escape of an accused
person. Corporal punishment preceded, as in the
case of Cinadon, the infliction of death; but was not a
separate penalty.<a id="noteref_1044" name="noteref_1044" href="#note_1044"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1044</span></span></a> On the other hand, infamy (ἀτιμία)
was the more frequently used as a punishment, from
the deep impression which it made on the mind of
a Spartan.<a id="noteref_1045" name="noteref_1045" href="#note_1045"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1045</span></span></a> The highest degree of this infamy, as
it appears, fell upon the coward, who either left the
ranks and fled from battle, or returned without the
rest of the army, as Aristodemus from Thermopylæ.<a id="noteref_1046" name="noteref_1046" href="#note_1046"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1046</span></span></a>
A person thus excommunicated could fill
no public office; had the lowest place in the choruses;
in the game of ball neither party would have him on
their side; he could find no competitor in the gymnasia,
no companion of his tent in the field. The
flame of his hearth was extinguished, as he was
unable to obtain fire from any person. He was
compelled to maintain his daughters at home, or, if
unmarried, to live in an empty house, since no one
would contract any alliance with him. In the street
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page233">[pg 233]</span><a name="Pg233" id="Pg233" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
he yielded to every one the way, and gave up his seat
to an inferior in age; his lost honour was at first
sight evident to every one from his ragged cloak, and
his half slavery, from his half-shorn head. Hence
many persons have asked, what merit it was in a
Spartan if he preferred death to flight, since a punishment
far worse than death awaited the coward? It
is indeed true, that the merit of each individual
Spartan was less if he preferred dying at his post
to saving himself by flight, than if public opinion had
not affixed so severe a penalty to the offence of the
cowardly soldier. But this argument would be equally
good against <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></em> public laws and ordinances, and even
against the expression of national feelings and opinion.
For the looser the bond of social union, and the more
anarchical the condition of any state, the greater
is the individual merit of any citizen who nevertheless
observes the rules of morality and justice, and the
praise of virtue is more considered as his particular
due. Whereas, when each citizen listens to the voice
of public opinion, and feels himself, as it were, bound
to support the national power, a large part of the
merit of individual excellence is taken away from the
individual, and bestowed on the public institutions.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A less severe description of infamy was the lot of
prisoners taken in war, who were not subject to the
imputation of cowardice, as, for instance, the captives
at Sphacteria. They were not allowed to fill any
public office, and were deprived of the privilege of
buying and selling. The other degrading restrictions
were not, however, enforced, and the time of
the punishment was limited.<a id="noteref_1047" name="noteref_1047" href="#note_1047"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1047</span></span></a>

Among this class of punishments may be included
the penalty of the unmarried, who were deprived of
the customary honours of old age. Young men were
also punished for various offences, by being compelled
to sing defamatory songs against themselves, a custom
corresponding with the inclination of the Doric race
to mirth and merriment, under which a very serious
character was frequently concealed. In the code of
Charondas, public ridicule was also assigned as the
penalty of the adulterer and busybody (πολυπράγμων),<a id="noteref_1048" name="noteref_1048" href="#note_1048"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1048</span></span></a>

in Sparta, for the law could hardly have
compelled a person to do that which, if he had done
it voluntarily, would have been punished with death.<a id="noteref_1050" name="noteref_1050" href="#note_1050"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1050</span></span></a>

but this cannot be considered as a case in point, for
the flight only took place for the purpose of avoiding
the revenge of relations. On the other hand, banishment
exempted a person from the most severe punishments,<a id="noteref_1052" name="noteref_1052" href="#note_1052"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1052</span></span></a>

The punishment of death was inflicted either by
strangulation in a room of the public prison called

also the senate of the Æolic Cume (whose antiquated

criminal cases during the night, and voted with covered
balls,<a id="noteref_1057" name="noteref_1057" href="#note_1057"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1057</span></span></a> nearly in the same manner as the kings

for the undisturbed execution of severe
sentences, but are to be attributed to the dread of
pronouncing and putting into execution the sentence
of death, and to an unwillingness to bring the terrors
of that penalty before the eye of day. A similar
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page236">[pg 236]</span><a name="Pg236" id="Pg236" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
repugnance is expressed in the practice of the Spartan
Gerusia, which never passed sentence of death without
several days' deliberation, nor ever without the most
conclusive testimony; the person who was acquitted
could however be always subjected to a fresh examination.<a id="noteref_1059" name="noteref_1059" href="#note_1059"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1059</span></span></a>
Notwithstanding this horror of shedding blood,
the punishments in the early Greek states were more
severe than under the Athenian republic. The orator
Lycurgus<a id="noteref_1060" name="noteref_1060" href="#note_1060"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1060</span></span></a> ascribes to the ancient legislators in general
the principle of the laws of Draco, to punish
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></em> actions with the same severity, whether the evil
which they caused was great or small. This severity
partly owed its origin to a supposition that the public
rights were injured, and not the property or the peace
of an individual. Thus the ancient law of Tenedos
(which, together with the worship of Apollo there
established, appears to have been derived from Crete)
punished adulterers by decapitation with an axe;<a id="noteref_1061" name="noteref_1061" href="#note_1061"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1061</span></span></a> the

5. The laws respecting the penalty of death, which
prevailed in the Grecian, and especially in the Doric
states, were derived from Delphi. They were entirely
founded upon the ancient rite of expiation, by which a
limit was first set to the fury of revenge, and a fixed mode of
procedure in such cases established.<a id="noteref_1064" name="noteref_1064" href="#note_1064"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1064</span></span></a> Any
person killing another without premeditation in the

to the law which (as Plato states)<a id="noteref_1065" name="noteref_1065" href="#note_1065"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1065</span></span></a> came from Delphi,
immediately released from all guilt, when he had been
purified: it is however probable, that much of what
the philosopher recommends in other cases was derived
from the institutions of Draco, as well as from the
Delphian laws, which were actually administered in the latter state
by the Pythian court of justice.<a id="noteref_1066" name="noteref_1066" href="#note_1066"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1066</span></span></a> To
what extent reconciliation with kinsmen by the payment
of a fine was permitted, and in what cases the
punishment of death was made compulsory, cannot be
ascertained. The Delphian court having unjustly
condemned Æsop to death, sentenced itself to the payment
of a fine, and discovered some descendants or
kinsmen of their victim, to whom the money was paid.<a id="noteref_1067" name="noteref_1067" href="#note_1067"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1067</span></span></a>
The Delphian institutions were doubtless connected
with those of Crete, where Rhadamanthus was reported
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page238">[pg 238]</span><a name="Pg238" id="Pg238" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
by ancient tradition to have first established courts of
justice, and a system of law,<a id="noteref_1068" name="noteref_1068" href="#note_1068"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1068</span></span></a> the larger and more
important part of which, in early times, is always the
criminal law. Now as Rhadamanthus is said to have
made exact retaliation the fundamental principle of his
code,<a id="noteref_1069" name="noteref_1069" href="#note_1069"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1069</span></span></a> it cannot be doubted, after what has been said
in the second book on the connexion of the worship of
Apollo and its expiatory rites with Crete, that in this
island the harshness of that principle was early softened
by religious ceremonies, in which victims and libations
took the place of the punishment which should have
fallen on the head of the offender himself.

occasion to mention the laws of Zaleucus (the earliest
written code which existed in Greece),<a id="noteref_1070" name="noteref_1070" href="#note_1070"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1070</span></span></a> actuated by a
belief that they were of Doric origin. The Epizephyrian
Locrians, amongst whom these laws were in
force, were indeed for the most part descendants of the
Ozolian and Opuntian Locrians.<a id="noteref_1071" name="noteref_1071" href="#note_1071"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1071</span></span></a> Aristotle describes
them as a collected rabble, in the true spirit of a mythologist,
carrying to the extreme the opposition between
recent regularity and early anarchy. These Locrians,
however, at the very first establishment of their city,
received the Doric customs, Syracusans from Corinth
having contributed largely to its foundation,<a id="noteref_1072" name="noteref_1072" href="#note_1072"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1072</span></span></a> besides
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page239">[pg 239]</span><a name="Pg239" id="Pg239" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
which the Spartans are said to have colonized Locri
during the first Messenian war. Although the time
may be doubtful, it is an additional confirmation of the
fact, that in an ancient war with the inhabitants of
Croton, the Locrians applied for assistance to the
Spartans, who promised them the assistance of their
gods of war, the Tyndaridæ. Locri was therefore
considered a Doric state, a character which was likewise
preserved in its dialect. The constitution was
also an oligarchy,<a id="noteref_1073" name="noteref_1073" href="#note_1073"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1073</span></span></a> in the hands apparently of a number
of Doric and Locrian families. We find in this state,
as well as in its mother-city Opus, the hundred families
who, by virtue of their nobility, enjoyed a large share
in the government.<a id="noteref_1074" name="noteref_1074" href="#note_1074"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1074</span></span></a> But that the aristocracy was
united with a timocracy appears to me to be proved by
the senate of a thousand; which, under the presidency
of the cosmopolis, constituted a supreme court of
justice,<a id="noteref_1075" name="noteref_1075" href="#note_1075"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1075</span></span></a>
and appears to have been formed in the manner
stated, if we may judge from the analogy of the senates
of Rhegium and Agrigentum: which argument seems
to have the greater weight, as such numerous councils
of an aristocratic character do not appear to have
existed in Greece, and they were evidently not democratic.

that they were founded upon the institutions of Crete,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page240">[pg 240]</span><a name="Pg240" id="Pg240" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Sparta, and the Areopagus, and upon those of the

brought into connexion with Thaletas, the expiatory
priest of Crete, and the spirit of his laws suited the
Pythagoreans (who proceeded upon the same Doric
usages and maxims), and in later days Pindar<a id="noteref_1078" name="noteref_1078" href="#note_1078"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1078</span></span></a> and
Plato.<a id="noteref_1079" name="noteref_1079" href="#note_1079"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1079</span></span></a> The prohibition to all citizens to leave

Doric, and therefore Spartan character;<a id="noteref_1081" name="noteref_1081" href="#note_1081"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1081</span></span></a> an institution
which forms the other side of the Xenelasia. Of the
same nature also is the firmness with which the legislation
was maintained, and every change guarded
against;<a id="noteref_1082" name="noteref_1082" href="#note_1082"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1082</span></span></a> they laboured to resist in every manner the
Ionic spirit of innovation; and if understood with a
slight allowance, it may be true that every person
arriving at Locri was punished, who inquired after
novelties.<a id="noteref_1083" name="noteref_1083" href="#note_1083"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1083</span></span></a> In the same spirit are the measures
adopted for securing as far as possible the inalienability
of landed property.<a id="noteref_1084" name="noteref_1084" href="#note_1084"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1084</span></span></a>
The same character is shown in
the strict sumptuary laws,<a id="noteref_1085" name="noteref_1085" href="#note_1085"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1085</span></span></a> and the superintendence of
public morals exercised by the nomophylaces, who
were, for example, empowered to admonish and to
punish slanderers.<a id="noteref_1086" name="noteref_1086" href="#note_1086"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1086</span></span></a> A certain progress is, however,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page241">[pg 241]</span><a name="Pg241" id="Pg241" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
shown in the rude attempts at a law of property, and
a more accurate assignment of punishments.<a id="noteref_1087" name="noteref_1087" href="#note_1087"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1087</span></span></a> It is
remarkable that both Zaleucus and Charondas annexed
a sort of recommendation to particular laws:<a id="noteref_1088" name="noteref_1088" href="#note_1088"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1088</span></span></a> whereas
nothing can be a greater proof of the total failure of a
system of laws, than when an endeavour is made to
demonstrate the expediency of arrangements, the truth
and necessity of which should be self-evident. This
statement must not, however, be thus understood: the
meaning is, that all the laws were by a short introduction
referred to some general principle; such, for
example, as <span class="tei tei-q">“In order not to offend the gods of
the families.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“In order that the state may
be well administered, and according to the laws of
our fathers.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Trusting that it will be salutary to
the people,”</span> (λώιον καὶ ἄμεινον, as the Delphic
oracle says on some occasion<a id="noteref_1089" name="noteref_1089" href="#note_1089"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1089</span></span></a>), &amp;c.; which seem to
me to be rather ancient formulas, suited to the simplicity
of the time, and inserted from a vague religious
feeling, than intended logically to establish, to the
satisfaction of the people, the wisdom and expediency
of the new laws.

1. The military system of the Dorians, which we
are now about to consider, was evidently brought to
the greatest perfection in Sparta. In this state the
military profession, as was hardly the case in any other
part of Greece, was followed as an art, as the study of
a life;<a id="noteref_1090" name="noteref_1090" href="#note_1090"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1090</span></span></a> so that when Agesilaus (as is related) separated
the shoemakers, carpenters, potters, &amp;c., from
the assembled allied army, the Spartans alone remained,
as being the warriors by profession (as
τεχνῖται τῶν πολεμικῶν<a id="noteref_1091" name="noteref_1091" href="#note_1091"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1091</span></span></a>). But the principles of
their military tactics were evidently common to the
whole race; and, according to a conjecture advanced
in a former part of this work,<a id="noteref_1092" name="noteref_1092" href="#note_1092"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1092</span></span></a> it was chiefly
the method of attack, in closed lines, with extended lances,
by which the Dorians conquered the Achæans of
Peloponnesus, and which was adopted from them by
many other states of Greece.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Every Spartan was, if he had sufficient strength,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page243">[pg 243]</span><a name="Pg243" id="Pg243" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
bound to defend his country in expeditions without
the boundaries during the years that were designated
by the name ἡλικία.<a id="noteref_1093" name="noteref_1093" href="#note_1093"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1093</span></span></a> This period lasted to the fortieth
year from manhood (ἀφ᾽ ἥβης), that is to say, to the
sixtieth year from birth:<a id="noteref_1094" name="noteref_1094" href="#note_1094"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1094</span></span></a> until that time a man was
called ἔμφρουρος (from φρουρὰ), and could not go out
of the country without permission from the authorities.<a id="noteref_1095" name="noteref_1095" href="#note_1095"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1095</span></span></a>
Of these, the younger men were sometimes sent
abroad; but those of fifty-five and upwards, not till the
state was in difficulty.<a id="noteref_1096" name="noteref_1096" href="#note_1096"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1096</span></span></a> The ephors stated
in the name of the public assembly the years, until which the
obligation to service in an individual case extended.<a id="noteref_1097" name="noteref_1097" href="#note_1097"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1097</span></span></a>
Upon the whole, the armies of Sparta must have contained
many aged triarii: while in Athens the liability
to foreign service generally terminated with the twenty-third
year of manhood; which was computed from the
eighteenth year.<a id="noteref_1098" name="noteref_1098" href="#note_1098"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1098</span></span></a> But Sparta reckoned upon a healthy
and strong old age; the time for deliberative sagacity
does not begin till the age for fighting has ended. The
allied army of the Argives, Arcadians, and Athenians
was, in 418 B.C., met by an army composed of all
the Spartans<a id="noteref_1099" name="noteref_1099" href="#note_1099"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1099</span></span></a> (that is, all the ἔμφρουροι<a id="noteref_1100" name="noteref_1100" href="#note_1100"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1100</span></span></a>); but they
dismissed from the boundaries a sixth part of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page244">[pg 244]</span><a name="Pg244" id="Pg244" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
army, consisting of the younger and the older, in order
to protect the capital.<a id="noteref_1101" name="noteref_1101" href="#note_1101"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1101</span></span></a>

<a name="Book_III_Chapter_XII_Section_2" id="Book_III_Chapter_XII_Section_2" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
2. In marching and in battle the Spartans endeavoured
to conceal their strength from the enemy; for
this reason the levies were hastily made by the ephors,
and the army sometimes marched during the night;<a id="noteref_1102" name="noteref_1102" href="#note_1102"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1102</span></span></a>
the depth of the ranks in the army was also very
various, and the enemy could not be certain of its
strength. In the battle of Mantinea there were seven
lochi, each containing four pentecostyes, the pentecostys
four enomoties, and the front row of the enomoty containing
four men: the pentecostys had therefore 16 in
front, the lochus 64, the whole army 448. According
to Thucydides the Spartans generally stood eight men
deep; therefore the whole number of the hoplitæ was
3584. To these however were added the 300 picked men about
the king, about 400 cavalry in both wings,<a id="noteref_1103" name="noteref_1103" href="#note_1103"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1103</span></span></a>
and also the old men, posted as a body of reserve with
the baggage, together with the Lacedæmonians,
appointed to cover the right wing of the allies, in
number perhaps about 500.<a id="noteref_1104" name="noteref_1104" href="#note_1104"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1104</span></span></a> The whole number of
men was 4784. A sixth part of the army had been
sent back; which gives for the entire army 5740 men.
This was at that time the number of heavy-armed
soldiers, which, after severe losses in the field, the city
of Sparta was able of itself to furnish:<a id="noteref_1105" name="noteref_1105" href="#note_1105"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1105</span></span></a> nor indeed is
it so considerable as the report of its strength would
lead one to suppose; but it increased, in the manner of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page245">[pg 245]</span><a name="Pg245" id="Pg245" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
an avalanche, into a numerous and powerful army,<a id="noteref_1106" name="noteref_1106" href="#note_1106"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1106</span></span></a>
when there was time to collect troops from the allies.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Although we have given the account of this battle
in the first instance, we cannot derive from it any
information with regard to the original regulation of
the army, since Agis had increased the lochi to four
times their usual strength, as we shall presently see,
in order to deceive the enemy by false accounts. For,
if we compare the statements of the well informed
Xenophon,<a id="noteref_1107" name="noteref_1107" href="#note_1107"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1107</span></span></a> we obtain the following explanation of
the names: two enomoties compose a pentecostys, two
pentecostyes a lochus,<a id="noteref_1108" name="noteref_1108" href="#note_1108"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1108</span></span></a> four lochi a mora; now if
an enomoty, as must have been originally the case,
contained twenty-four,<a id="noteref_1109" name="noteref_1109" href="#note_1109"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1109</span></span></a> or, with the enomotarch,
twenty-five men,<a id="noteref_1110" name="noteref_1110" href="#note_1110"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1110</span></span></a> the mora would have contained
400; and, including the superior officers, pentecosters,
and lochagi, 412. In the time of Xenophon, however,
the enomoty consisted of thirty-six men<a id="noteref_1111" name="noteref_1111" href="#note_1111"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1111</span></span></a>; and
accordingly, the mora of 600, as was the case on an
occasion mentioned by the same historian<a id="noteref_1112" name="noteref_1112" href="#note_1112"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1112</span></span></a>;
the other numbers, which vary between 500<a id="noteref_1113" name="noteref_1113" href="#note_1113"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1113</span></span></a> and 900,<a id="noteref_1114" name="noteref_1114" href="#note_1114"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1114</span></span></a> must
also have resulted from the greater or less increase in
the strength of the enomoty.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. Now the enomoty, the most simple body of this
military arrangement, was, as the word shows, a file of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page246">[pg 246]</span><a name="Pg246" id="Pg246" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
men closely united, and bound by a common oath,<a id="noteref_1115" name="noteref_1115" href="#note_1115"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1115</span></span></a>
which stood in the deep phalanx each one behind the
other,<a id="noteref_1116" name="noteref_1116" href="#note_1116"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1116</span></span></a> the enomotarch being in front (πρωτοστάτης)
of the whole file. Thus also the Thebans stood in
files twenty-five men deep,<a id="noteref_1117" name="noteref_1117" href="#note_1117"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1117</span></span></a> which they sometimes
strengthened to double that number<a id="noteref_1118" name="noteref_1118" href="#note_1118"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1118</span></span></a>; in
the Lacedæmonian army, however, the file was generally broken,
and the enomoty, according to the order given before
the battle, stood three and sometimes six men broad<a id="noteref_1119" name="noteref_1119" href="#note_1119"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1119</span></span></a>;
in the former case, if its number was not increased,
eight; in the latter, four deep: the Lacedæmonians
are also reported to have once beaten the Arcadians
with a line only one shield deep.<a id="noteref_1120" name="noteref_1120" href="#note_1120"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1120</span></span></a> If, however, the
whole enomoty stood in one file, it was called λόχος
ὄρθιος; and in this disposition they attacked high
places, when the files were placed at some distance
from each other.<a id="noteref_1121" name="noteref_1121" href="#note_1121"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1121</span></span></a> The deployments (παραγωγαὶ),
by which the phalanx was made more or less deep,
were ordered by the enomotarch. This person was
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page247">[pg 247]</span><a name="Pg247" id="Pg247" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the strongest man or the best soldier of the whole
enomoty; hence it was his continual care that on
whatever point the attack was made he should always
stand at the head of his file: the uragi, however, the
last men of the file, were experienced soldiers, especially
when the army was expected to be threatened in
the rear. If then the lochi moved one behind the
other (ἐπὶ κέρως), the enomotarchs advanced before the
long files. If the enemy approached in front, the
files, either whole or broken, moved forward, each
placing itself on the left side of the preceding file
(παρ᾽ ἀσπίδα<a id="noteref_1122" name="noteref_1122" href="#note_1122"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1122</span></span></a>). If the enomoty was broken, the
enomotarch then occupied in the square formed by
his enomoty the front angle to the right hand, and the
first enomotarch of the army was always the last man
of the right wing; this movement was called παραγωγὴ
εἰς μέτωπον, or ἐπὶ φάλαγγος.<a id="noteref_1123" name="noteref_1123" href="#note_1123"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1123</span></span></a> But if the
enemy came on in the rear, each file wheeled round, so that
the leaders again came in front.<a id="noteref_1124" name="noteref_1124" href="#note_1124"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1124</span></span></a> If the enemy
appeared on the right, the whole number of lochi,
moving one behind the other, turned, like triremes,
towards the enemy, and the man who was last upon
the march was last in the line of battle to the right
(παρὰ δόρυ). And, lastly, if they advanced from the
left, the same movement took place, only the last lochus then
occupied the left wing (παρ᾽ ἀσπίδα<a id="noteref_1125" name="noteref_1125" href="#note_1125"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1125</span></span></a>).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<a name="Book_III_Chapter_XII_Section_4" id="Book_III_Chapter_XII_Section_4" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
4. Lochi also occur among the Argives and Thebans,
and in the Asiatic armies; under the command
of Sparta there were lochi of mercenaries and bowmen,<a id="noteref_1126" name="noteref_1126" href="#note_1126"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1126</span></span></a> &amp;c.; whereas the mora was a division peculiar
to the Spartans. The formation of this body was as
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page248">[pg 248]</span><a name="Pg248" id="Pg248" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
follows. The whole number of citizens (τὸ πολιτικὸν)
was divided into six moras<a id="noteref_1127" name="noteref_1127" href="#note_1127"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1127</span></span></a>; so that every person of
military age (ἔμφρουρος), even while he lived at
Sparta, belonged to one of them. The strength of
the mora in the field depended on the maximum fixed
by the ephors for the age of those employed; thus,
for example, they were able to send out a mora composed
of persons less than thirty-five years from manhood (ἀφ᾽ ἥβης)
and keep back those of greater age,<a id="noteref_1128" name="noteref_1128" href="#note_1128"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1128</span></span></a>
&amp;c. So that in this sense the numbers of the division
depended upon circumstances. To each mora of heavy-armed
infantry there belonged, without being in close
connexion with it, a body of cavalry bearing the same
name,<a id="noteref_1129" name="noteref_1129" href="#note_1129"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1129</span></span></a>
consisting at the most of 100 men, and commanded
by the hipparmost.<a id="noteref_1130" name="noteref_1130" href="#note_1130"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1130</span></span></a> In the mora of the
infantry, however, the men of different ages must have
been in some manner separated, so that, for example,
those between thirty and thirty-five years of age could
be easily detached for pursuit.<a id="noteref_1131" name="noteref_1131" href="#note_1131"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1131</span></span></a> In this division no
respect was had to kindred; soldiers of one mora had
brothers, sons, fathers, in another,<a id="noteref_1132" name="noteref_1132" href="#note_1132"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1132</span></span></a> although in
early times it appears to have been an object of the greatest
care to bring relations and friends together. According
to Herodotus<a id="noteref_1133" name="noteref_1133" href="#note_1133"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1133</span></span></a>
Lycurgus instituted the enomoties,
triacades, and syssitia for war; evidently as military
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page249">[pg 249]</span><a name="Pg249" id="Pg249" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
divisions; and the Lacedæmonians ate and fought
in the same company; from which we may explain
why the polemarchs had also a superintendence over
the public tables.<a id="noteref_1134" name="noteref_1134" href="#note_1134"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1134</span></span></a> By these the larger divisions, and
not the single banqueting companies, are intended;
when Sparta, in the reign of king Agis, again contained
4500 families, there were fifteen of these
divisions<a id="noteref_1135" name="noteref_1135" href="#note_1135"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1135</span></span></a>; and in earlier times, when the number of
families was 9000, there were probably thirty; it is
therefore doubtless another name for oba, which rarely
occurs; and the army was arranged according to
tribes, phratrias, and houses. In early times also
the single hamlets of Sparta furnished lochi of their
own; as were the Pitanatæ<a id="noteref_1136" name="noteref_1136" href="#note_1136"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1136</span></span></a>

5. Of the two principles upon which the regulation
of the Lacedæmonian army was founded, one (as has
been already pointed out) belonged more peculiarly
to early times, and at a late period nearly disappeared:
I mean the complete union and amalgamation
of the army in all its parts. This is expressed
by the name <span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">enomoty</span></span>; and we are led to the same

result by many other remarkable vestiges, such as the
proximity of the lovers to the loved (which in certain
situations must have produced a strong effect upon
the feelings), and the sacrifices to Love, which, according
both to the Spartan and Cretan usage, the
most beautiful men performed before the battle. The
second principle was of longer duration; the duty
of implicit obedience to every person in authority
(πειθαρχία). Now in the artificial organization of
the army almost all Spartans were in a certain
respect commanders<a id="noteref_1138" name="noteref_1138" href="#note_1138"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1138</span></span></a>; for not only the front men of
the files, even when the enomoties were broken (πρωτοστάται),
but the first men of every line (ζευγῖται) were
officers<a id="noteref_1139" name="noteref_1139" href="#note_1139"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1139</span></span></a>; nay, every two persons throughout the
whole enomoty were connected with each other as fore-man
and rear-man (πρωτοστάτης and ἐπιστάτης.<a id="noteref_1140" name="noteref_1140" href="#note_1140"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1140</span></span></a>)
The commands (παραγγέλσεις) passed rapidly through
the polemarchs, lochagi, &amp;c, to the enomotarchs, who gave them
out, like heralds, in a loud voice<a id="noteref_1141" name="noteref_1141" href="#note_1141"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1141</span></span></a>;
but that the command alone of the immediate superior
held good, is proved by the circumstance that
the disobedience of a polemarch or lochagus entailed
the disobedience of the whole lochus.<a id="noteref_1142" name="noteref_1142" href="#note_1142"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1142</span></span></a> The polemarchs,

took possession of the booty; the hellanodicæ, who
decided disputes in the army (in this case, as well as

lastly, those who had conquered in crowned contests
were in the king's train<a id="noteref_1158" name="noteref_1158" href="#note_1158"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1158</span></span></a>; a train indeed of sufficient
importance, and fit in so simple a state of society to
surround the descendant of Hercules with an appearance
of dignity. The Thirty about the king's person
are not identical with the damosia; for these were
always Spartans, which we cannot say of flute-players,
&amp;c.; they were assigned to the king, even when the rest
of the army (as was frequently the case in expeditions in
Asia) consisted exclusively of neodamodes,<a id="noteref_1159" name="noteref_1159" href="#note_1159"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1159</span></span></a> and were
probably at the same time the body-guard and council
of the king. They may therefore be considered as
the 300 contracted into a small body, which accompanied
the king only on expeditions to a small
distance from home. These 300 were the picked
regiment of Sparta, the flower of the youth, as the
gerontes were of the old men, and also chosen on
aristocratic principles. For the ephors appointed
three hippagretæ, each of whom chose one hundred
young men, with a statement of the grounds of his
selection; from the number of those discharged from
this body the five agathoergi were taken, who for the
space of a year served the state in missions.<a id="noteref_1160" name="noteref_1160" href="#note_1160"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1160</span></span></a>

6. A similar body in the Cretan states really consisted
of horsemen; the Spartans were called horsemen,
and were in fact heavy-armed infantry<a id="noteref_1161" name="noteref_1161" href="#note_1161"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1161</span></span></a>; the
cause of which was, the low estimation of the cavalry-service
among the Lacedæmonians. The country
was fitted rather for the production of men than of
horses; and although the citizens furnished both the
horse and accoutrements, they were ridden only by
weak and inferior persons.<a id="noteref_1162" name="noteref_1162" href="#note_1162"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1162</span></span></a> Thus the
horsemen of Sparta, the number of whom in the Peloponnesian
war was at first 400, and afterwards rose to 600,<a id="noteref_1163" name="noteref_1163" href="#note_1163"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1163</span></span></a>
effected nothing against the better mounted and
practised cavalry of Bœotia, which as the light-armed
riders sometimes mounted behind, sometimes vaulted
off rapidly, was doubly formidable to the enemy.<a id="noteref_1164" name="noteref_1164" href="#note_1164"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1164</span></span></a>
Among the other Doric states, Tarentum in particular
had a numerous<a id="noteref_1165" name="noteref_1165" href="#note_1165"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1165</span></span></a> and very excellent
light cavalry.<a id="noteref_1166" name="noteref_1166" href="#note_1166"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1166</span></span></a>
The preference for a force of this description is a
proof, according to the principles of antiquity, of an
unstable and effeminate character, exactly the reverse
of that exhibited by the heavy-armed soldiery of the
Lacedæmonians.

have no express statement of their mode of arms, we
can hardly suppose that they were heavy-armed troops,
since they were particularly employed when a rapid
change of position, or a vigorous attack, such as
storming of heights, &amp;c., was required<a id="noteref_1171" name="noteref_1171" href="#note_1171"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1171</span></span></a>; they were
often at the post of greatest danger.<a id="noteref_1172" name="noteref_1172" href="#note_1172"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1172</span></span></a> Originally,
doubtless, they were, as they were called, inhabitants
of the district Sciritis, on the confines of Laconia,
towards Parrhasia<a id="noteref_1173" name="noteref_1173" href="#note_1173"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1173</span></span></a>; their rights and
duties appear to have been defined by agreement; their mode of fighting
was also perhaps Arcadian. The other Periœci
appear only to have taken part in large expeditions,
and such as were prepared for a considerable time
beforehand; and they probably served for the most
part as hoplitæ<a id="noteref_1174" name="noteref_1174" href="#note_1174"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1174</span></span></a>; the ratio of their number, as well

It is not by any means clear in what manner the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page255">[pg 255]</span><a name="Pg255" id="Pg255" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Peloponnesian armies were accompanied by such
numerous bodies of light-armed soldiers, more particularly
of Helots.<a id="noteref_1176" name="noteref_1176" href="#note_1176"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1176</span></span></a> It must at the same time be
borne in mind that the Persian war was the only time,
that is, on a general summons of the nation, when so
many as seven attended upon every Spartan<a id="noteref_1177" name="noteref_1177" href="#note_1177"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1177</span></span></a>; on
this occasion, when the numbers of the enemy were
so excessive, they might have served to protect the
rear of the long line of battle, and to resist the pressure;
in addition to which they also annoyed the
enemy from behind with slings, javelins, and stones.
A large part of them, in the capacity of attendants
(θεράποντες, ἐρυκτῆρες, ὑπασπισταὶ), were also destined
exclusively for the service of the hoplitæ, and
to rescue them in danger<a id="noteref_1178" name="noteref_1178" href="#note_1178"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1178</span></span></a>; another portion was probably
detached to convoy and cover the baggage
(στρατὸς σκευοφορικός). The Peloponnesians in early
times never attempted to form separate divisions of
light-armed soldiers, such as the peltasts were, who,
in addition to the javelin, bore the small shield of
the Thracians and Illyrians.<a id="noteref_1179" name="noteref_1179" href="#note_1179"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1179</span></span></a> The perfection of this
species of troops, especially after the improvement
of Chabrias and Iphicrates, was the cause of severe
injury to the heavy-armed tactics of the Spartans;
and the Peloponnesians dreaded them for a long time,

7. The attention of Sparta was almost exclusively
directed to the heavy infantry; and it can scarcely be
denied that this was carried by them to the highest
pitch of perfection. The arms<a id="noteref_1181" name="noteref_1181" href="#note_1181"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1181</span></span></a> consisted of a long

respects also more similar to the shield of the heroic
age than that of the other Greeks. For while the
Greeks in general had adopted the Carian handle
(ὀχάνη) in order to direct the motion of the shield,
of which the size had been considerably reduced, the
Spartan buckler was probably suspended upon a
thong (τελαμὼν) laid round the neck, and was only
managed by a ring (πόρπαξ) fastened to the concave
side, which in time of peace could be taken out.<a id="noteref_1186" name="noteref_1186" href="#note_1186"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1186</span></span></a>

8. The principles of the Lacedæmonian tactics may
be deduced from what has been already said on the
subject of the enomoty, and of its movements; the
deployment of the enomoty (the ἐξελιγμὸς) was the
chief means of opposing the best soldiers to the
enemy,<a id="noteref_1188" name="noteref_1188" href="#note_1188"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1188</span></span></a> and it was from this movement
in particular that victory was expected. A particular kind of this
manœuvre was called the Laconian; it began from
the enomotarchs, who faced about to the right, and
passed in an oblique direction between their own and
the next file; the whole file, following its leader,
placed itself in front of the uragus, who merely faced
to the right about. So that the whole phalanx,
by this means, turning their faces towards the enemy
who appeared in the rear, advanced at the same time
in that direction by the depth of the order of battle.
The Macedonian mode was different from this; for
in that the movement began from the uragus, and
therefore the phalanx lost, instead of gained, the same
space of ground as it covered; and the Cretan (called
also <span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">Choreus</span></span>) differed from both, as the
enomotarch and uragus both moved, until they changed places, and
consequently, according to this method, the phalanx
remained on the same ground.<a id="noteref_1189" name="noteref_1189" href="#note_1189"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1189</span></span></a> In a charge it was
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page258">[pg 258]</span><a name="Pg258" id="Pg258" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the duty of the general to take care that the army constantly
inclined somewhat further to the right than
the exact line of its intended direction, since each man
naturally endeavoured to bring his unprotected side
under the shield of his neighbour, and the last man on
the right wing to turn away that side from the danger,
and therefore to outflank the left of the enemy:<a id="noteref_1190" name="noteref_1190" href="#note_1190"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1190</span></span></a>
this was also the cause of the weakness of the right wing,
which they endeavoured to remedy by putting in it the
best troops, and by protecting it with cavalry. Before
Epaminondas discovered the art of concentrating the
battle in the spot in which he was strongest, and of
keeping the rest of the enemy's troops unengaged, the
general had to attend to two points. In the first place,
that the chief charge of his own men should be made
upon that part where it appeared most easy and advantageous
to break the line; and that at the same
time his own line should withstand the charge of the
enemy: and, secondly, he might endeavour to obtain
the victory by extending his front so as to outflank the
enemy; a manœuvre which the Spartans seldom
indeed attempted, being content to hinder the enemy
from effecting it. The chief point was to keep the
whole body of men in compact order, both in rapid
advance and in pretended flight:<a id="noteref_1191" name="noteref_1191" href="#note_1191"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1191</span></span></a> no bravery could
excuse a man for quitting his post.

humanity which we cannot but admire. War was as much as
possible confined to a measure of strength; and battle,
as Mardonius in Herodotus describes that of the
Greeks in general,<a id="noteref_1200" name="noteref_1200" href="#note_1200"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1200</span></span></a> was a kind of duel upon the
principles of honour. In Peloponnesus, as well as in
Eubœa,<a id="noteref_1201" name="noteref_1201" href="#note_1201"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1201</span></span></a> the use of the different species of arms had
perhaps been regulated by the appointment of general
councils; Sparta also retained with a religious veneration
the ancient institutions of sacred truces; as, for
instance, the Olympic armistice: it wished not only to
celebrate its native festivals in quiet,<a id="noteref_1202" name="noteref_1202" href="#note_1202"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1202</span></span></a> but even respected
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page260">[pg 260]</span><a name="Pg260" id="Pg260" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
foreign solemnities; thus, at so late a period as 391
B.C., that state allowed itself to be delayed and deceived
by an appeal of the Argives to <span class="tei tei-q">“the sacred
months.”</span><a id="noteref_1203" name="noteref_1203" href="#note_1203"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1203</span></span></a> If then the state, so long as
it remained true to these principles, did not slaughter its enemies
without aim or object, so much the more sparing was
it of its own soldiers, every moderate loss being
severely felt; but even in the engagements of the
hoplitæ few of the victorious party were lost. Every
one knows of the tearless battle between the Spartans
and Arcadians, in which the state had no dead to
mourn.<a id="noteref_1204" name="noteref_1204" href="#note_1204"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1204</span></span></a> Nothing therefore can be less laid to the
charge of Sparta than a violent passion for war, a
foolhardy and reckless desire of conquest. The latter
was also guarded against by the maxim of Lycurgus,<a id="noteref_1205" name="noteref_1205" href="#note_1205"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1205</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“not to go often against the same enemy,”</span> the non-observance
of which was a charge brought against
Agesilaus. With what unwillingness the Lacedæmonians
engaged in great wars is generally known.
And yet in every action in the open field, up to the
battle of Leuctra, Sparta had nearly a certainty of
success,<a id="noteref_1206" name="noteref_1206" href="#note_1206"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1206</span></span></a> since the consciousness of skill in the use of
arms was added to the national feeling of the Doric
race, that victory over the Ionians was not a matter of
doubt.<a id="noteref_1207" name="noteref_1207" href="#note_1207"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1207</span></span></a> With what timidity did the Athenians attack

Their feeling towards the captives was nearly
the same as that of the Achæans in Homer to the
corpse of Hector.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These opinions necessarily experienced innumerable
modifications when Sparta engaged in foreign warfare,
and moved out of her own orbit into an unknown
region; this was particularly the case in maritime war,
which, although followed in early times by Corinth,
Ægina, and Corcyra, never agreed with the nature of
the Doric tribe. For this reason Sparta, although
after many unsuccessful attempts she gave birth to
men who had considerable talents for this service, as
Callicratidas and Lysander, and for a time her fleet
was very numerous, and the commander of it a second
king,<a id="noteref_1208" name="noteref_1208" href="#note_1208"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1208</span></span></a> never showed any particular inclination for it.
A disinclination equally strong, and formed upon the
same grounds, was shown by the Spartans to the
storming of walled places (πυργομαχεῖν<a id="noteref_1209" name="noteref_1209" href="#note_1209"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1209</span></span></a>) for which
reason they never in early times constructed any
defences of this kind; and despised the use of machines,
by which Archidamus, the son of Agesilaus,
thought that <span class="tei tei-q">“man's strength was annihilated.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<a name="Book_III_Chapter_XII_Section_10" id="Book_III_Chapter_XII_Section_10" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
10. We conclude with the assertion with which we
prefaced this chapter, though in a different point of
view, that no nation ever considered war as an art in
the same sense and to the same degree as the Doric
Spartans. Indeed every nation, of a military disposition,
and addicted to warlike pursuits, considers war
not merely as a means of repelling the attacks of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page262">[pg 262]</span><a name="Pg262" id="Pg262" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
enemies, or of gaining plunder or territory by being
itself the invader. The mere act of fighting, the common
and disciplined movement of thousands directed
to the same end, the <span class="tei tei-q">“pomp, pride, and circumstance
of glorious war,”</span> arouse the feelings, and inspire the
mind with the noblest and most elevated thoughts; and
there is a certain affinity between the art of war and
the more regular and peaceful arts; thus a military
body resembled, in its movements and array, a large
choral dance. These feelings and views were among
all nations most natural to the Greeks, and, of the
Greek races, familiar to the Dorians in particular.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The agreement which some moderns<a id="noteref_1210" name="noteref_1210" href="#note_1210"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1210</span></span></a> have found
between the Greek chorus and the lochus is not a mere
creation of the fancy; the large chorus was a pentecostys
in number, which was divided into enomoties
(hemichoria); it advanced in certain divisions, like an
army, and had corresponding evolutions.<a id="noteref_1211" name="noteref_1211" href="#note_1211"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1211</span></span></a> Both the
dance and the battle were the object of the Pyrrhic,
which was particularly practised in Sparta and Crete.<a id="noteref_1212" name="noteref_1212" href="#note_1212"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1212</span></span></a>
In early times it was a preparation for battle, an
use of it which was neglected in a later age; in the
soldier heavy-armed for the battle was also seen the
practised dancer of the Pyrrhic. The same connexion
is alluded to by Homer, where Æneas hopes to overthrow
Meriones of Crete, however good a dancer he
may be:<a id="noteref_1213" name="noteref_1213" href="#note_1213"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1213</span></span></a> thus also the Thessalians called the soldiers
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page263">[pg 263]</span><a name="Pg263" id="Pg263" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the front ranks <span class="tei tei-q">“principal dancers;”</span> and said of a
good fighter, that <span class="tei tei-q">“he had danced well.”</span><a id="noteref_1214" name="noteref_1214" href="#note_1214"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1214</span></span></a>
For the same reason Homer calls hoplitæ by the name πρυλέες<a id="noteref_1215" name="noteref_1215" href="#note_1215"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1215</span></span></a>
the war-dance having been called πρύλις by the Cretans.<a id="noteref_1216" name="noteref_1216" href="#note_1216"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1216</span></span></a>
Now this latter expression is used by Homer
in the passages in which both Greeks and Trojans
give up the usual method of fighting, and the heroes
descend from their chariots and form themselves into
a body on foot; and therefore of that very mode of
battle which became prevalent in Greece through the
influence of the Dorians. For the same reason the
Spartans sacrificed to the Muses before an action,<a id="noteref_1217" name="noteref_1217" href="#note_1217"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1217</span></span></a>
these goddesses being expected to produce regularity
and order in battle; as they sacrificed on the same
occasion in Crete to the god of love, as the confirmer
of mutual esteem and shame.<a id="noteref_1218" name="noteref_1218" href="#note_1218"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1218</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The whole existence of the Spartans in the camp
appears to have been easy and tranquil; and therefore
resembled the mode of living in Sparta, as that city
was to a certain degree always a camp.<a id="noteref_1219" name="noteref_1219" href="#note_1219"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1219</span></span></a> The bodily

the discipline in general was less strict. The Persian
spy found the Spartans in the evening before the battle
of Thermopylæ employed, some in gymnastic exercises,
and some in arranging their hair,<a id="noteref_1222" name="noteref_1222" href="#note_1222"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1222</span></span></a> which they
always wore long after their entrance into manhood.
Every man put on a crown<a id="noteref_1223" name="noteref_1223" href="#note_1223"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1223</span></span></a> when the band of flute-players
gave the signal for attack; all the shields of
the line glittered with their high polish,<a id="noteref_1224" name="noteref_1224" href="#note_1224"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1224</span></span></a> and mingled
their splendour with the dark red of the purple
mantles,<a id="noteref_1225" name="noteref_1225" href="#note_1225"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1225</span></span></a> which were meant both to adorn the combatant,
and to conceal the blood of the wounded; to
fall well and decorously being an incentive the more to
the most heroic valour.

1. Having examined the political institutions of
the Doric states, we next proceed to consider
their private life and domestic economy; which two
subjects were so intimately connected in the habits
of this race, that we shall not attempt to separate
them by any exact line of distinction. Our observations
will be confined to those matters which appear
most to exhibit the peculiar character of the Dorians.
For which purpose, having first considered their domestic
conveniences, such as dwellings, &amp;c., we will
proceed to their domestic relations, their arts, and
literature.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. The dwellings of the Dorians were plain and
simple. By a law of Lycurgus the doors of every
house were to be fashioned only with the saw, and the
ceiling with the axe;<a id="noteref_1226" name="noteref_1226" href="#note_1226"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1226</span></span></a> not that the legislator intended
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page266">[pg 266]</span><a name="Pg266" id="Pg266" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to abolish altogether the science of architecture, but
merely to restrain it to its proper objects, viz., temples
and public buildings, and to prevent it from purveying
to private luxury. The kings of Greece in Homer's
time lived not only in spacious, but also richly ornamented
houses, the walls of which glittered with brass,
silver, gold, amber, and ivory; but no such splendour
was seen in the dwellings of the Heraclide princes.
The palace of the two kings of Sparta was said to
have been built by Aristodemus at the taking of the
town; here Agesilaus lived after the manner of his
ancestors; the doors even in his time being, according
to Xenophon's somewhat exaggerated expression,
those of the original building.<a id="noteref_1227" name="noteref_1227" href="#note_1227"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1227</span></span></a> Hence Leotychidas
the elder (490 B.C.) asked his host at Corinth
(which city had early risen to riches and luxury), on
seeing the ceiling ornamented with sunken panels
(φατνώματα), <span class="tei tei-q">“whether the trees in Corinth were
naturally four-cornered.”</span><a id="noteref_1228" name="noteref_1228" href="#note_1228"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1228</span></span></a> The houses at Sparta,
however, notwithstanding their rude structure, were
probably spacious and commodious; in front there
was generally a court-yard, separated by a wall from
the street,<a id="noteref_1229" name="noteref_1229" href="#note_1229"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1229</span></span></a> and containing a large portico. The towns
of Peloponnesus were for the most part irregularly
built, whereas the Ionians had early learnt to lay out
their streets in straight lines,<a id="noteref_1230" name="noteref_1230" href="#note_1230"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1230</span></span></a> a custom which Hippodamus
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page267">[pg 267]</span><a name="Pg267" id="Pg267" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of Miletus succeeded in spreading over the rest
of Greece. It was probably this architect who in the
year 445 B.C. laid out the plan of Thurii<a id="noteref_1231" name="noteref_1231" href="#note_1231"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1231</span></span></a> in exact squares, with streets
at right angles;<a id="noteref_1232" name="noteref_1232" href="#note_1232"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1232</span></span></a> and the
same who in his old age built the city of Rhodes
(407 B.C.), the plan of which was designed with
such perfect symmetry, that, according to the expression
of the astonished ancients, it seemed <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">like one
house</span></span>.<a id="noteref_1233" name="noteref_1233" href="#note_1233"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1233</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. The principles of Lycurgus, however, we repeat
did not in the least degree retard the progress of
real architecture. Indeed we know that in the embellishment
of their sacred edifices the Dorians employed
a style of building which they themselves
invented, from the strict principles of which they
never deviated, and which at the same time they took
the utmost care to bring to perfection. That they
were in strictness the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">original inventors</span></em> of this style
of architecture has been first satisfactorily proved by
the remarkable discoveries of modern times, which
have laid open to us the monuments of the unknown
ages of Greece in all their strange peculiarities. The
treasury of Atreus is indeed the only example now
extant of a class of buildings doubtless once very numerous;<a id="noteref_1234" name="noteref_1234" href="#note_1234"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1234</span></span></a>
but its paraboloidal construction distinguishes
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page268">[pg 268]</span><a name="Pg268" id="Pg268" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
it as well from the later Grecian as the oriental style
of architecture. Near this structure some fragments
of columns have been discovered by modern travellers,<a id="noteref_1235" name="noteref_1235" href="#note_1235"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1235</span></span></a>
remarkable both for the variety of their forms and the
richness of their ornaments; still the spot on which
they were found, as well as their singular shape, leave
no doubt that they belong to the same unknown period.
They consist, first, of the base of a fluted column,
with a plinth, and also a torus of elliptical outline,
decorated with an alternation of projecting and receding
compartments, the former of which have in some
cases an ornament of spiral lines; secondly, a fragment
of the shaft of a column of bronze-coloured
marble, similarly ornamented with compartments;
thirdly, a very small fragment of a capital; and,
lastly, a tablet of white marble, with a species of ornament
in imitation of shells. There are in the British
Museum two tablets of light green and dark red
marble, both taken from the treasury of Atreus,
which have the spiral lines above mentioned, and are
worked very elaborately, though without mathematical
precision.<a id="noteref_1236" name="noteref_1236" href="#note_1236"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1236</span></span></a> We have given this description of a
style of architecture, not strictly belonging to our subject,
in order to direct the reader's attention to these
most remarkable remains of Grecian sculpture, which
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page269">[pg 269]</span><a name="Pg269" id="Pg269" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
are quite sufficient to convince us that the building to
which they belong, thus adorned with party-coloured
stones, and probably covered in the interior with plates
of bronze, may be reckoned as the monument of a
time when a semi-barbarous style of architecture prevailed
throughout Greece.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. In direct contrast with the above is the simple
unornamented character and unobtrusive grandeur
of the style unanimously called by the ancients <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the
Doric</span></span>.<a id="noteref_1237" name="noteref_1237" href="#note_1237"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1237</span></span></a> It appears certain that the first hints of this
order were borrowed from buildings constructed of
wood, a fact which I cannot reconcile with the supposition
of a foreign origin. For we should thus lose
sight altogether of the gradual and regular progress
by which it advanced to maturity, and suppose that the
improvements of foreign artificers, with their peculiar
principles, and those of native architects, looking only
to the original structure of wood, were blended, or
rather violently confused together. Could anything
be more natural than that the long surface of the
principal beams should be imitated in stone, that the
cross-beams with the Doric triglyph should be laid
over these, the intervals or metopes being by degrees
covered with marble, whilst the cornice, in imitation
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page270">[pg 270]</span><a name="Pg270" id="Pg270" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of carpenters' work, was allowed to project in bold
relief? The roof perhaps was for some time allowed
to end in a slope on each side; Corinth was the first
place where the front and hind part were finished off
with a pediment; the tympanum being adorned with
statues of ancient clay-work.<a id="noteref_1238" name="noteref_1238" href="#note_1238"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1238</span></span></a> Such was the origin
of the Doric temple, of which early models have been
preserved in the Doric towns of Corinth and Pæstum,
in Ægina, and the Doric colonies of Sicily.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We cannot however suppose it to have been the
opinion of the historian of ancient architecture,<a id="noteref_1239" name="noteref_1239" href="#note_1239"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1239</span></span></a> that
the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">artistical</span></em> character of the Doric architecture may
be satisfactorily derived from wooden buildings. It is
the essence of this art to connect, by the varieties of
form and proportion, a peculiar association of ideas
with works intended merely for purposes of necessity.
The Doric character, in short, created the Doric architecture.
In the temples of this order the weight to be
supported is intentionally increased, and the architrave,
frieze, and cornice, of unusual depth; but the columns
are proportionably strong, and placed very close to
each other; so that, in contemplating the structure,
our astonishment at the weight supported is mingled
with pleasure at the security imparted by the strength
of the columns underneath. This impression of firmness
and solidity is increased by the rapid tapering of
the column, its conical shape giving it an appearance
of strength; while the diminution beginning immediately
at the base, and the straight line not being,
as in other orders, softened by the interposition of the
swelling, gives a severity of character to the order.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
With this rapid diminution is also connected the bold
projection of the echinus (or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quarter-round</span></span>) of the capital;
which likewise creates a striking impression,
particularly if its outline is nearly rectilineal. The
alternation of long unornamented surfaces with smaller
rows of decorated work awakens a feeling of simple
grandeur, without appearing either monotonous or
fatiguing. The harmony spread over the whole becomes
more conspicuous when contrasted with the dark
shadows occasioned by the projecting drip of the cornice;
above, the magnificent pediment crowns the
whole. Thus in this creation of art we find expressed
the peculiar bias of the Doric race to strict rule,
simple proportion, and pure harmony.

1. The next point which we have to consider is
the mode of clothing in use among the Dorians; in
which a peculiar taste was displayed; an ancient
decorum and simplicity, equally removed from the
splendour of Asiatics and the uncleanliness of barbarians.
At the same time, however, they paid considerable
attention to their personal appearance, although
their manners did not require the body to be studiously
and completely covered. A Dorian was the first who
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page272">[pg 272]</span><a name="Pg272" id="Pg272" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in the lists of Olympia threw off the heavy girdle,
which the wrestlers of Homer had worn in common
with those of barbarous countries, and ran naked to
the goal;<a id="noteref_1240" name="noteref_1240" href="#note_1240"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1240</span></span></a> in fact a display of the naked form, when
all covering was useless, and indeed inconvenient, was
altogether in harmony with the Doric character. This
reminds us of the nakedness of the Spartan young
women, even in the time of Athenian civilization,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page273">[pg 273]</span><a name="Pg273" id="Pg273" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
which custom gave rise to the joke, that <span class="tei tei-q">“the Spartans
showed foreigners their virgins naked.”</span><a id="noteref_1241" name="noteref_1241" href="#note_1241"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1241</span></span></a> On this
subject, however, it is necessary that we should enter
into greater detail.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<a name="Book_IV_Chapter_II_Section_2" id="Book_IV_Chapter_II_Section_2" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
2. In the first place these words direct our attention
to the different modes of life of the married and unmarried
women among the Dorians. Modern manners,
derived from the age of chivalry, carefully withdraw
young women from all impressions calculated to inflame
the passions; while married women are more
exposed to intercourse with men. But, according to
the colder notions of the Greeks, which are seen most
clearly among the Dorians, the unmarried lived more
in public than the married women; who attended more
to the care of their family; and hence the former alone
practised music and athletic exercises; the latter
being occupied only with their household affairs.<a id="noteref_1242" name="noteref_1242" href="#note_1242"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1242</span></span></a> This
explains why at Sparta unmarried women appeared
with their faces uncovered, while the married only
went out in veils;<a id="noteref_1243" name="noteref_1243" href="#note_1243"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1243</span></span></a> and it was common to see the
former walking in the streets with young men,<a id="noteref_1244" name="noteref_1244" href="#note_1244"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1244</span></span></a> which
was certainly not permitted to the others; and so also
at Sparta,<a id="noteref_1245" name="noteref_1245" href="#note_1245"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1245</span></span></a> in Crete,<a id="noteref_1246" name="noteref_1246" href="#note_1246"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1246</span></span></a> and at Olympia,
virgins were permitted to be spectators of the gymnastic contests,
and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">married</span></em> women only were excluded;<a id="noteref_1247" name="noteref_1247" href="#note_1247"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1247</span></span></a> the reverse
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page274">[pg 274]</span><a name="Pg274" id="Pg274" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of which was the case in Ionia, where the unmarried
women were usually shut up in the interior of the
houses.<a id="noteref_1248" name="noteref_1248" href="#note_1248"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1248</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This different position in society was also marked
by the dress, which was lighter and less strict among
the unmarried women; for it is these alone who are
charged with exposure of their persons. This charge
of the Athenians was, however, caused by a strange
forgetfulness of ancient custom; for after the mode of
treatment of their women had become precisely similar
to that of the eastern nations, the ancient Greek usage
appeared to them unnatural;<a id="noteref_1249" name="noteref_1249" href="#note_1249"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1249</span></span></a> and the dress of the
Doric women caused in their minds the same notions
as the German dress in those of the Romans; of which
Tacitus says, <span class="tei tei-q">“the German women wear the arms
naked up to the shoulders, and even the next part of
the breast is uncovered; <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">notwithstanding which</span></em>
they never break the marriage vow.”</span>

3. On the dress of the Spartans I need only, after
the labours of former writers,<a id="noteref_1250" name="noteref_1250" href="#note_1250"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1250</span></span></a> make the following
remarks. The chief, or indeed the only garment of
the Doric virgin is by ancient writers sometimes called
<span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">himation</span></span>,<a id="noteref_1251" name="noteref_1251" href="#note_1251"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1251</span></span></a> sometimes
<span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">chiton</span></span>: the former more correctly,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page275">[pg 275]</span><a name="Pg275" id="Pg275" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
as appears from works of art; and the latter
word was used metaphorically, from the resemblance of
the himation to the linen chiton of the Ionians. This
garment of woollen stuff was without sleeves, and
fastened over both shoulders by clasps (πόρπαι,
περόναι), which were often of considerable size;<a id="noteref_1252" name="noteref_1252" href="#note_1252"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1252</span></span></a> while
the Ionic women wore sleeves of greater or less length.<a id="noteref_1253" name="noteref_1253" href="#note_1253"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1253</span></span></a>
This chiton was only joined together on one side,
while on the other it was left partly open or slit up
(σχιστὸς χίτων<a id="noteref_1254" name="noteref_1254" href="#note_1254"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1254</span></span></a>); probably it could be fastened with
clasps, or opened wider, so as to admit a freer motion
of the limbs, so that the two skirts (πτέρυγες) flew
open; whence Ibycus called the Spartan women
φαινομηρίδες.<a id="noteref_1255" name="noteref_1255" href="#note_1255"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1255</span></span></a> This garment was also worn without
a girdle; when it hung down to the calves of the legs.<a id="noteref_1256" name="noteref_1256" href="#note_1256"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1256</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This is generally the dress with which the goddesses
Victory and Iris are represented in works of art, the
latter particularly among the statues from the pediment
of the Parthenon, in which rapid motion is indicated
by the chiton being thrown from the feet and
ancles on the left side; and in the same chiton,
though with more ample folds, is the dress of Athene
in many statues of the more finished and perfect
style of the art: and Artemis, the huntress, in the
Doric chiton, girt up for the purpose of rapid
motion.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In one of these different fashions, according to her
object and business, the virgin of Sparta, generally
without the himation,<a id="noteref_1257" name="noteref_1257" href="#note_1257"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1257</span></span></a> wore a single garment, and
appeared even in the company of men without any further
covering. Thus Periander the Corinthian<a id="noteref_1258" name="noteref_1258" href="#note_1258"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1258</span></span></a> was
seized with love for the beautiful Melissa at Epidaurus,
when he saw her dressed, after the Peloponnesian
manner, in her chiton, without any upper garment, as
she was giving out wine to the labourers.<a id="noteref_1259" name="noteref_1259" href="#note_1259"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1259</span></span></a> In this
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page277">[pg 277]</span><a name="Pg277" id="Pg277" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
costume the Doric virgins might be seen dancing at
their places of exercise and in the chorus.<a id="noteref_1260" name="noteref_1260" href="#note_1260"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1260</span></span></a> The married
women, however, never appeared without an
upper garment; which probably was not essentially
different from the himation of the men: thus, for
example, the wife of Phocion, who lived in the Doric
manner, according to the account of Plutarch, often
went out in the himation of her husband.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. This leads us to consider the costume of the
men, the chief parts of which we will describe generally,
before we speak of them in detail. These then
are, first, the chiton, a woollen shirt without sleeves,
worn by all the Greeks and Italians, the only dress of
boys;<a id="noteref_1261" name="noteref_1261" href="#note_1261"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1261</span></span></a> since it was not till after the increase of luxury
in Athens that they began to dress young boys in the
himation.<a id="noteref_1262" name="noteref_1262" href="#note_1262"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1262</span></span></a> Secondly, the himation, called in Homer
χλαῖνα.<a id="noteref_1263" name="noteref_1263" href="#note_1263"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1263</span></span></a> a square piece of cloth, sometimes rounded
off at the corners, which was commonly thrown over
the left, and behind under the right arm, and the end
was again brought back over the left shoulder.<a id="noteref_1264" name="noteref_1264" href="#note_1264"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1264</span></span></a>
Thirdly, the chlamys (Θετταλικὰ πτέρα), of Macedonian
and Thessalian origin,<a id="noteref_1265" name="noteref_1265" href="#note_1265"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1265</span></span></a> an oblong piece of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page278">[pg 278]</span><a name="Pg278" id="Pg278" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
cloth, of which the two lower ends came forward, and
were fastened with a clasp upon the right shoulder;
so that it left that arm free. This latter dress is never
mentioned in the poems of Homer. Sappho was the
first among the Greek poets who spoke of it.<a id="noteref_1266" name="noteref_1266" href="#note_1266"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1266</span></span></a> It was
not therefore till after her time that its use was extended
over Greece Proper, first as the dress of horsemen,
and young men in general, and then as a military
cloak; under which character it was introduced into
Sparta.<a id="noteref_1267" name="noteref_1267" href="#note_1267"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1267</span></span></a> The earliest painted vases, however, always
represent the warriors in the himation, which is commonly
without folds, and drawn close to the body.<a id="noteref_1268" name="noteref_1268" href="#note_1268"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1268</span></span></a>

were the first to adopt a simpler mode of dress</span></span>:”</span> a
statement which is founded on a peculiar notion of
this historian, that the loose linen garments, which
were still worn by old-fashioned people at Athens in
the time of Aristophanes, were the original Greek
dress; whereas we know with tolerable certainty that
this dress was brought over to Athens by the Ionians
of Asia.<a id="noteref_1270" name="noteref_1270" href="#note_1270"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1270</span></span></a> The Athenians again laid this aside at the
time of the Peloponnesian war, and returned to the
thin clothing of the ancient Greeks; with the exception
of the women, who had formerly at Athens worn
the Doric costume, but now retained the Ionic dress
with long sleeves, wide folds, and trailing hem, which
was generally of linen. Thucydides, however, is so
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page279">[pg 279]</span><a name="Pg279" id="Pg279" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
far right, that the Lacedæmonians were distinguished
among all the Greeks for their scanty and simple
clothing: thus the Lacedæmonian habit,<a id="noteref_1271" name="noteref_1271" href="#note_1271"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1271</span></span></a> the τρίβων,<a id="noteref_1272" name="noteref_1272" href="#note_1272"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1272</span></span></a>
was of thick cloth and small size,<a id="noteref_1273" name="noteref_1273" href="#note_1273"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1273</span></span></a> which the youths<a id="noteref_1274" name="noteref_1274" href="#note_1274"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1274</span></span></a>

submitted.

5. As at Athens the style of dress indicated the
rank and station of the wearer, so also the Doric
manners were clearly expressed in the arrangement
of the clothes. Thus, for example, it was generally
recognised in Greece that holding the arms
within the cloak was a sign of modesty;<a id="noteref_1276" name="noteref_1276" href="#note_1276"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1276</span></span></a> and hence
the Spartan youths, like the Roman in the first
year of their manhood, appeared always in the street
with both hands under their cloak and their eyes cast
down, <span class="tei tei-q">“resembling statues,”</span> says Xenophon,<a id="noteref_1277" name="noteref_1277" href="#note_1277"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1277</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“in
their silence, and in the immoveability of their eyes,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page280">[pg 280]</span><a name="Pg280" id="Pg280" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and more modest than virgins in the bridal chamber.”</span>
In the same manner the youths of lower Italy, in
which there were many Doric cities, are frequently
represented on vases, with the arms folded under the
cloak, which is indicated by the large fold across the
breast.<a id="noteref_1278" name="noteref_1278" href="#note_1278"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1278</span></span></a>

prevailing rule. Manufacturers of ointment were
excluded from Sparta, as being corrupters of oil:
dyers, because they deprived the wool of its beautiful
white colour.<a id="noteref_1280" name="noteref_1280" href="#note_1280"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1280</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“Deceitful are ointments, and

idea.<a id="noteref_1281" name="noteref_1281" href="#note_1281"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1281</span></span></a> Even in the cities which had early departed

Among the accompaniments of the toilette may be

remarked, that the Lacedæmonian custom only admitted
of two kinds; viz., the cold daily baths in the

1. With respect to the food and meals of the Dorians,
we will only mention those points which are
connected with some historical or moral fact, since
we have already considered this subject in connexion
with the economy of the state.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the first place, the adherence of the Dorians to
ancient Greek usages is visible in their custom of
eating together, or of the <span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">syssitia</span></span>.
For these public
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page284">[pg 284]</span><a name="Pg284" id="Pg284" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
tables were not only in use among the Dorians
(with whom, besides in Crete and Sparta, they also
existed at Megara in the time of Theognis,<a id="noteref_1301" name="noteref_1301" href="#note_1301"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1301</span></span></a> and at
Corinth in the time of Periander),<a id="noteref_1302" name="noteref_1302" href="#note_1302"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1302</span></span></a> but they had also
once been a national custom among the Œnotrians<a id="noteref_1303" name="noteref_1303" href="#note_1303"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1303</span></span></a> and their kinsmen the Arcadians, particularly at
Phigalia;<a id="noteref_1304" name="noteref_1304" href="#note_1304"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1304</span></span></a>
and among the Greeks of Homer the princes
at least eat together, and at the cost of the community;
a custom which was retained by the Prytanes at
Athens, Rhodes, and elsewhere. In particular, the
public tables of Sparta have in many points a great
resemblance to the Homeric banquets
(δαῖτες)<a id="noteref_1305" name="noteref_1305" href="#note_1305"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1305</span></span></a>; only
that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></em> the Spartans were in a certain manner considered
as princes. The Spartans, however, so far
departed from the ancient custom, that at the time of
Alcman they <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">lay</span></em><a id="noteref_1306" name="noteref_1306" href="#note_1306"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1306</span></span></a> at table; while the Dorians of

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page285">[pg 285]</span><a name="Pg285" id="Pg285" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
early Romans, according to the ancient European
usage, which was entirely supplanted among the
early Greeks by the oriental custom introduced by the
Ionians.

2. With regard to the food, it is probable that in
Sparta much had been retained from ancient usage,
and that the rest had been from its first origin peculiar
to the nation. The profession of cook at Sparta was,
as we have already remarked,
hereditary,<a id="noteref_1308" name="noteref_1308" href="#note_1308"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1308</span></span></a> and consequently
they had no inducement to vie with one another
in the delicacy and luxury of their dishes: they
cooked the black broth, as their ancestors had done
before them. It was likewise more difficult to make
dishes of various ingredients, on account of the division
of the different departments of cookery; for instance,
some cooks were only allowed to dress flesh, others to
make broth,<a id="noteref_1309" name="noteref_1309" href="#note_1309"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1309</span></span></a> &amp;c. The bakers, whose trade also was
hereditary, generally baked nothing but barley-bread
(ἄλφιτα);<a id="noteref_1310" name="noteref_1310" href="#note_1310"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1310</span></span></a> wheaten bread was only eaten at the
dessert of the public tables, when presented by liberal
individuals.<a id="noteref_1311" name="noteref_1311" href="#note_1311"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1311</span></span></a> The latter kind of bread was originally
scarce in Greece, whither it was introduced chiefly
from Sicily;<a id="noteref_1312" name="noteref_1312" href="#note_1312"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1312</span></span></a>
in which country they had also a particular
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page286">[pg 286]</span><a name="Pg286" id="Pg286" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
kind of Doric wheaten bread, of coarser meal
than was common elsewhere.<a id="noteref_1313" name="noteref_1313" href="#note_1313"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1313</span></span></a> The chief dish of meat
at the public tables was the black broth (μέλας ζωμὸς);<a id="noteref_1314" name="noteref_1314" href="#note_1314"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1314</span></span></a>
also pork,<a id="noteref_1315" name="noteref_1315" href="#note_1315"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1315</span></span></a> the meat being subjected to
stricter regulations than any other kind of food.<a id="noteref_1316" name="noteref_1316" href="#note_1316"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1316</span></span></a> Poultry
and game were generally eaten after dinner: beef,

Their mode of drinking was also that of the
ancient Greeks; which, as far as I am aware, is only
mentioned in Homer. Before each person was placed
a cup, which was filled by the cup-bearer with mixed
wine, when it had been emptied; the wine was however
never passed round, and no person drank to
another; which were Lydian customs introduced by
the Ionians.<a id="noteref_1318" name="noteref_1318" href="#note_1318"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1318</span></span></a> Both in Sparta and Crete it was

3. But a still more beautiful feature in the Doric
character is the friendly community of their public
tables, founded upon the close union of the company
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page287">[pg 287]</span><a name="Pg287" id="Pg287" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the tables (ἑταιρία in

members were admitted by unanimous election (by
ballot).<a id="noteref_1322" name="noteref_1322" href="#note_1322"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1322</span></span></a> Whether a preference was shown to kinsmen
is uncertain; the syssitia indeed, as divisions of
the state, were founded upon a supposed relationship,
that is, the connexion of
houses;<a id="noteref_1323" name="noteref_1323" href="#note_1323"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1323</span></span></a> but here we are
speaking of smaller societies, consisting of about
fifteen men. A company of this kind was a small
state in itself,<a id="noteref_1324" name="noteref_1324" href="#note_1324"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1324</span></span></a>
arranged upon aristocratical principles,<a id="noteref_1325" name="noteref_1325" href="#note_1325"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1325</span></span></a>
although the equality was not interrupted by the privileges
of any individuals. The ties of this friendly
union were however drawn still closer by the constant
intercourse of giving and taking, which enriched the
scanty meal with the more palatable <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">after-meal</span></span>
(ἐπάϊκλον) or dessert, which no one was permitted
to purchase:<a id="noteref_1326" name="noteref_1326" href="#note_1326"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1326</span></span></a> from which the κοπὶς should be distinguished,
a sacrificial feast, which individuals furnished
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page288">[pg 288]</span><a name="Pg288" id="Pg288" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
on stated occasions, and invited to it any
friends whom they wished, and particularly the
kings.<a id="noteref_1327" name="noteref_1327" href="#note_1327"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1327</span></span></a> The phiditia were not, however, considered
a scanty and disagreeable meal, until thrown in the
shade by the refinements of modern luxury; for they
had originally been intended to increase the comforts
of the partakers. The conversation, indeed, turned
chiefly upon public affairs:<a id="noteref_1328" name="noteref_1328" href="#note_1328"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1328</span></span></a> but laughter and jocularity
were not prohibited.<a id="noteref_1329" name="noteref_1329" href="#note_1329"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1329</span></span></a> Every person was encouraged
to speak by the general confidence, and
there were frequent songs, as Alcman says that <span class="tei tei-q">“at
the banquets and drinking entertainments of the
men, it was fit for the guests to sing the pæan.”</span><a id="noteref_1330" name="noteref_1330" href="#note_1330"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1330</span></span></a>
Nor was the appellation φειδίτια, that is, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">spare</span></em>,
or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">scanty meals</span></em>, of any antiquity, and the Spartans
received it from abroad:<a id="noteref_1331" name="noteref_1331" href="#note_1331"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1331</span></span></a> by whom, as well as in

men.<a id="noteref_1332" name="noteref_1332" href="#note_1332"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1332</span></span></a> For the men alone were admitted to them:
the youths and boys ate in their own divisions, whilst
the small children were allowed to eat at the public
tables, and both in Crete and Sparta they sat on low
stools near their fathers' chairs, and received a half
share without any vegetables (ἀβαμβάκευστα).<a id="noteref_1333" name="noteref_1333" href="#note_1333"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1333</span></span></a> The
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page289">[pg 289]</span><a name="Pg289" id="Pg289" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
women were never admitted to the syssitia of the men:
both at Sparta and in Crete the rule was, that they
ate at home;<a id="noteref_1334" name="noteref_1334" href="#note_1334"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1334</span></span></a> in the latter state, however, a woman
had the care of the tables of the men.<a id="noteref_1335" name="noteref_1335" href="#note_1335"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1335</span></span></a> The Cretans
were distinguished by their great hospitality: for
every two tables of the citizens there was always one
for foreigners; and when two cities were in close
alliance with one another, their citizens mutually
enjoyed the right of frequenting the public tables of
the other state.<a id="noteref_1336" name="noteref_1336" href="#note_1336"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1336</span></span></a>

4. This temperance and simplicity, which was
longest preserved in Crete and Sparta, were considered
by the ancients as characterizing generally the whole
Doric race, and a simple mode of cookery was called
Doric;<a id="noteref_1337" name="noteref_1337" href="#note_1337"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1337</span></span></a> although many cities of that race, such as

abandoned the severe and sober habits of their race;

1. We now proceed to describe the different relations
in the domestic life of the Dorians; and first,
that between man and wife. Here it will be necessary
to contradict the idea, that the duties of private
life were but little esteemed by the Doric race, particularly
at Sparta, and were sacrificed to the duty
owed to the community. The Lacedæmonian maxim
was in direct opposition to this doctrine; viz., that
the door of his court<a id="noteref_1341" name="noteref_1341" href="#note_1341"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1341</span></span></a> was the boundary of every
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page291">[pg 291]</span><a name="Pg291" id="Pg291" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
man's freedom:<a id="noteref_1342" name="noteref_1342" href="#note_1342"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1342</span></span></a> without, all owned the authority of
the state; within, the master of the house ruled as
lord on his own ground;<a id="noteref_1343" name="noteref_1343" href="#note_1343"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1343</span></span></a> and the rights of domestic
life, notwithstanding their frequent collision with the
public institutions, were more respected than at Athens.
At the same time, however, a peculiar national custom,
which pervaded the whole system of legislation, prevailed
throughout these relations with a force and
energy, which we, taking the accounts of the ancients
as our guide, will endeavour now to examine. It has
been above remarked how, in accordance with the
manners of the east, but in direct opposition to the
later habits of the Greeks,<a id="noteref_1344" name="noteref_1344" href="#note_1344"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1344</span></span></a> a free intercourse in public
was permitted by the Dorians to the youth of both
sexes, who were brought into contact particularly at
festivals and choruses.<a id="noteref_1345" name="noteref_1345" href="#note_1345"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1345</span></span></a>
Hence Homer represents the
Cretan chorus as composed of young men and women,
who dance hand in hand.<a id="noteref_1346" name="noteref_1346" href="#note_1346"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1346</span></span></a> At Sparta in particular the
young men lived in the presence of the unmarried
women, and as their derision was an object of dread,
so to be the theme of their praise was the highest
reward for noble actions.<a id="noteref_1347" name="noteref_1347" href="#note_1347"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1347</span></span></a> Hence it was very possible
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page292">[pg 292]</span><a name="Pg292" id="Pg292" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
at Sparta, that affection and love, although not of a
romantic nature, should take possession of the heart:
but at Athens, as far as my recollection goes, we have
not a single instance of a man having loved a free-born
woman, and marrying her from any strong affection,
whilst a single narrative of Herodotus<a id="noteref_1348" name="noteref_1348" href="#note_1348"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1348</span></span></a> contains two
love stories at Sparta. How many opportunities may
have been given by the festivals, as for instance the
Hyacinthia, at which the Spartan damsels were seen
going about in κάναθρα (ornamented cars peculiar to

2. Two things were, however, requisite as an introduction
and preparation to marriage at Sparta, first,
betrothing on the part of the father;<a id="noteref_1352" name="noteref_1352" href="#note_1352"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1352</span></span></a> secondly, the
seizure of the bride. The latter was clearly an ancient
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page293">[pg 293]</span><a name="Pg293" id="Pg293" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
national custom, founded on the idea that the young
woman could not surrender her freedom and virgin
purity unless compelled by the violence of the stronger
sex. They married, says Plutarch, by ravishing.
The bridegroom brought the young virgin, having
carried her off from the chorus of maidens or elsewhere,
to the bride's maid, who cut short her hair, and
left her lying in a man's dress and shoes, without a
light, on a bed of rushes, until the bridegroom returned
from the public banquet, carried the bride to
the nuptial couch, and loosened her girdle.<a id="noteref_1353" name="noteref_1353" href="#note_1353"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1353</span></span></a> And this
intercourse was for some time carried on clandestinely,
till the man brought his wife, and frequently her
mother, into his house. That this usage was retained
to the last days of Sparta may be inferred from the
fact, that the young wife of Panteus was still in the
house of her parents, and remained there, when he
went with Cleomenes to Egypt.<a id="noteref_1354" name="noteref_1354" href="#note_1354"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1354</span></span></a> A similar
custom must have prevailed in Crete, where we find, that the
young persons who were dismissed at the same time
from the agele, were immediately married, but did not
till some time after introduce their wives into their
own house.<a id="noteref_1355" name="noteref_1355" href="#note_1355"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1355</span></span></a> The children born before this took place

3. The age of marriage was fixed by the ancient
Greeks and western nations much later than at a subsequent
period by those of the east. Following the
former, the laws of Sparta did not allow women of
too tender an age to be disposed of in marriage. The
women were generally those at the highest pitch of
youthful vigour<a id="noteref_1359" name="noteref_1359" href="#note_1359"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1359</span></span></a> (called in Rhodes
ἀνθεστηριάδες),<a id="noteref_1360" name="noteref_1360" href="#note_1360"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1360</span></span></a>
and for the men, about the age of thirty was esteemed
the most proper, as we find in Hesiod,<a id="noteref_1361" name="noteref_1361" href="#note_1361"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1361</span></span></a> Plato,<a id="noteref_1362" name="noteref_1362" href="#note_1362"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1362</span></span></a> and
even Aristotle. Public actions might however be
brought against those who married too late (γραφὴ
ὀψιγαμίου), to which those also were liable who had
entered into unsuitable marriages (γραφὴ κακογαμίου),
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page295">[pg 295]</span><a name="Pg295" id="Pg295" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and those who remained unmarried (γραφὴ ἀγαμίου).<a id="noteref_1363" name="noteref_1363" href="#note_1363"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1363</span></span></a>
It is well known that these laws have been blamed as
a violation of the rights of individuals, and even a profanation
of the rite of marriage: but these censors
should have remembered that they were judging those
institutions by principles which the founders of them
would not have recognised. For the Spartans considered
marriage, not as a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">private relation</span></em>, about
which the state had little or no interest, but as a
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">public institution</span></em>, in order to rear up a strong and
healthy progeny to the nation. In Solon's legislation,
marriage was also placed under the inspection of the
state, and an action for not marrying (γραφὴ ἀγαμίου<a id="noteref_1364" name="noteref_1364" href="#note_1364"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1364</span></span></a>), though merely as a relic of antiquity, existed at
Athens. It is nevertheless true that marriage, especially
in Sparta, was, to a certain degree, viewed with
a primitive simplicity, which shocks the feelings of
more refined ages, as the peculiar object of matrimony
was never kept out of sight. Leonidas, when despatched
to Thermopylæ, is said to have left as a
legacy to his wife Gorgo the maxim, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Marry nobly,
and produce a noble offspring</span></span>;<a id="noteref_1365" name="noteref_1365" href="#note_1365"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1365</span></span></a> and when Acrotatus
had fought bravely in the war against Pyrrhus, the
women followed him through the town, and some of the
older ones shouted after him, <span class="tei tei-q">“Go, Acrotatus, enjoy
yourself with Chelidonis, and beget valiant sons for
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page296">[pg 296]</span><a name="Pg296" id="Pg296" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

in various cases<a id="noteref_1367" name="noteref_1367" href="#note_1367"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1367</span></span></a> (such as are known to us have been

enjoined the marriage duties to be transferred to another;
always, however, providing that the sanctity of
the marriage union should be for a certain time sacrificed
to that which the Doric race considered as of
higher importance, viz., the maintenance of the family.
That these cases were so defined by custom, as to
leave but little room for the effects of caprice or passion,
is evident from the infrequency of adultery at Sparta:<a id="noteref_1369" name="noteref_1369" href="#note_1369"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1369</span></span></a>
but the above aim justified even king Anaxandridas,
when, contrary to all national customs, he cohabited
with two wives,<a id="noteref_1370" name="noteref_1370" href="#note_1370"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1370</span></span></a> who lived without doubt in
separate houses. To marry foreign women was certainly forbidden
to all Spartans, and to the Heraclidæ by a
separate rhetra;<a id="noteref_1371" name="noteref_1371" href="#note_1371"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1371</span></span></a> contrary to the custom in
other Grecian towns, especially Athens, whose princes in
early times, as Megacles, Miltiades, &amp;c., frequently
contracted marriages with foreigners.

4. The domestic relation of the wife to her husband
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page297">[pg 297]</span><a name="Pg297" id="Pg297" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
among the Dorians was in general the same as that of
the ancient western nations, described by Homer as
universal among the Greeks, and which existed at
Rome till a late period; the only difference being,
that the peculiarities of the custom were preserved by
the Dorians more strictly than elsewhere. It formed
a striking contrast with the habits of the Ionic Athenians,
with whom the ancient custom of Greece was
almost entirely supplanted by that of the east.<a id="noteref_1372" name="noteref_1372" href="#note_1372"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1372</span></span></a>
Amongst the Ionians of Asia, the wife (as we are
informed by Herodotus<a id="noteref_1373" name="noteref_1373" href="#note_1373"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1373</span></span></a>) shared indeed the bed, but
not the table of her husband; she dared not call him
by his name, but addressed him with the title of lord,
and lived secluded in the interior of the house: on this
model the most important relations between man and
wife were regulated at Athens. But amongst the
Dorians of Sparta, the wife<a id="noteref_1374" name="noteref_1374" href="#note_1374"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1374</span></span></a> was honoured by her husband
with the title of mistress (δέσποινα),<a id="noteref_1375" name="noteref_1375" href="#note_1375"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1375</span></span></a> (a
gallantry belonging to the north of Greece, and also practised
by the Thessalians<a id="noteref_1376" name="noteref_1376" href="#note_1376"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1376</span></span></a>), which was used neither ironically
nor unmeaningly. Nay, so strange did the importance
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page298">[pg 298]</span><a name="Pg298" id="Pg298" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
which the Lacedæmonian women enjoyed, and the
influence which they exercised as the managers of their
household, and mothers of families, appear to the
Greeks, at a time when the prevalence of Athenian
manners prevented a due consideration for national
customs, that Aristotle<a id="noteref_1377" name="noteref_1377" href="#note_1377"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1377</span></span></a> supposed Lycurgus to have
attempted, but without success, to regulate the life of
women as he had that of the men; and the Spartans
were frequently censured for submitting to the yoke of
their wives.<a id="noteref_1378" name="noteref_1378" href="#note_1378"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1378</span></span></a> Nevertheless Alcman, generally a great
admirer of the beauty of Lacedæmonian women, could
say, <span class="tei tei-q">“It becomes a man to say much, and a woman
to rejoice at all she hears.”</span><a id="noteref_1379" name="noteref_1379" href="#note_1379"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1379</span></span></a> In accusing the
women of Sparta, however, for not essentially assisting
their country in times of necessity, Aristotle has
in the first place required of them a duty which even
in Sparta lay out of their sphere, and in the second
place, his assertion has been sufficiently contradicted
by the events of a subsequent period, in the last days
of Sparta, which acquired a surprising lustre from
female valour.<a id="noteref_1380" name="noteref_1380" href="#note_1380"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1380</span></span></a> On the whole, however, little as the
Athenians esteemed their own women, they involuntarily
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page299">[pg 299]</span><a name="Pg299" id="Pg299" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
revered the heroines of Sparta, such as Gorgo
the wife of Leonidas, Lampito the daughter of Leotychidas,
the wife of Archidamus and mother of Agis;<a id="noteref_1381" name="noteref_1381" href="#note_1381"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1381</span></span></a>
and this feeling is sometimes apparent even in the
coarse jests of Aristophanes.

5. How this indulgent treatment of the women
among the Dorians produced a state of opinion entirely
different from that prevalent at Athens, has
been intimated above, and will be further explained
hereafter. In general it may be remarked, that while
among the Ionians women were merely considered in
an inferior and sensual light, and though the Æolians
allowed their feelings a more exalted tone, as is proved
by the amatory poetesses of Lesbos;<a id="noteref_1382" name="noteref_1382" href="#note_1382"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1382</span></span></a> the Dorians, as
well at Sparta as in the south of Italy, were almost
the only nation who esteemed the higher attributes of
the female mind as capable of cultivation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is hardly necessary to remark, that in considering
the rights and duties of the wife, as represented in
the above pages, to apply to the whole Doric race,
allowance must be made for the alterations introduced
into different towns, particularly by foreign intercourse
and luxury. At Corinth, for instance, the institution
of the sacred slaves (ἱερόδουλοι) in the temple of Aphrodite,
probably introduced from Asia Minor, produced
a most prejudicial effect on the morals of that city,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page300">[pg 300]</span><a name="Pg300" id="Pg300" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and made it the ancient and great resort of courtesans.<a id="noteref_1383" name="noteref_1383" href="#note_1383"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1383</span></span></a>

6. Having now considered the personal relations
between the sexes, we next come to those depending
on difference of age; which from the Doric principle
of the elders instructing the younger, are intimately
connected with education.<a id="noteref_1384" name="noteref_1384" href="#note_1384"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1384</span></span></a> But before we
enter on that subject, it will be necessary to speak
of a connexion (termed by the Greeks παιδεραστία),
which, so long as it was regulated by the ancient
Doric principles, to be recognised both in the Cretan
laws and those of Lycurgus, had great influence
on the instruction of youth. We will first state the
exact circumstances of this relation, and then make
some general remarks on it; but without examining it
in a moral point of view, which does not fall within the
scope of this work.

him away to his apartment (ἀνδρεῖον), and afterwards,
with any chance companions, either to the mountains
or to his estate. Here they remained two months (the
period prescribed by custom), which were passed
chiefly in hunting together. After this time had
expired, the lover dismissed the youth, and at his
departure gave him, according to custom, an ox, a
military dress, and brazen cup, with other things; and
frequently these gifts were increased by the friends of

lover; and he had complete liberty by law to punish
any insult or disgraceful treatment. It depended now
on the choice of the youth whether the connexion
should be broken off or not. If it was kept up, the
companion in arms (παραστάτης), as the youth was
then called, wore the military dress which had been
given him; and fought in battle next his lover, inspired
with double valour by the gods of war and love,
according to the notion of the Cretans;<a id="noteref_1406" name="noteref_1406" href="#note_1406"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1406</span></span></a> and even in
man's age he was distinguished by the first place and
rank in the course, and certain insignia worn about the
body.

Institutions, so systematic and regular as these, did
not indeed exist in any Doric state except Crete and
Sparta; but the feelings on which they were founded
seem to have been common to all the Dorians. The
love of Philolaus, a Corinthian of the family of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page304">[pg 304]</span><a name="Pg304" id="Pg304" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Bacchiadæ, and the lawgiver of Thebes, and of Diocles
the Olympic conqueror, lasted until death; and even
their graves were turned towards one another, in token
of their affection:<a id="noteref_1407" name="noteref_1407" href="#note_1407"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1407</span></span></a> and another
person of the same name was honoured in Megara, as a noble instance of
self-devotion for the object of his love.<a id="noteref_1408" name="noteref_1408" href="#note_1408"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1408</span></span></a>

<a name="Book_IV_Chapter_IV_Section_8" id="Book_IV_Chapter_IV_Section_8" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
8. It is indeed clear that a custom of such general
prevalence cannot have originated from any accidental
impression or train of reasoning; but must have been
founded on feelings natural to the whole Doric race.
Now that the affection of the lover was not entirely
mental, and that a pleasure in beholding the beauty
and vigour, the manly activity and exercises<a id="noteref_1409" name="noteref_1409" href="#note_1409"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1409</span></span></a> of the
youth was also present, is certain. But it is a very
different question, whether this custom, universally
prevalent both in Crete and Sparta, followed by the
noblest men, by the legislators encouraged with all
care, and having so powerful an influence on education,
was identical with the vice to which in its name
and outward form it is so nearly allied.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The subject should be carefully considered, before,
with Aristotle, we answer this question in the affirmative,
who not only takes the fact as certain, but even
accounts for it by supposing that the custom was instituted
by the legislator of Crete as a check to population.<a id="noteref_1410" name="noteref_1410" href="#note_1410"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1410</span></span></a>
Is it, I ask, likely that so disgraceful a vice,
not practised in secret, but publicly acknowledged and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page305">[pg 305]</span><a name="Pg305" id="Pg305" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
countenanced by the state, not confined to a few individuals,
but common for centuries to the whole people,
should really have existed, and this in the race of all
the Greeks, the most distinguished for its healthy, temperate,
and even ascetic habits? These difficulties
must be solved before the testimony of Aristotle can be
received.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I will now offer what appears to me the most probable
view of this question. The Dorians seem in
early times to have considered an intimate friendship
and connexion between males as necessary for their
proper education. But the objection which would
have presented itself in a later age, viz. the liability to
abuse of such a habit, had then no existence, as has
been already remarked by a learned writer.<a id="noteref_1411" name="noteref_1411" href="#note_1411"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1411</span></span></a> And
hence they saw no disadvantage to counterbalance the
advantages which they promised themselves in the
unrestrained intercourse which would be the natural
consequence of the new institution. It is also true
that the manners of simple and primitive nations generally
have and need less restraint than those whom a
more general intercourse and the greater facility of
concealment have forced to enact prohibitory laws.
This view is in fact confirmed by the declaration of
Cicero, that the Lacedæmonians brought the lover into
the closest relation with the object of his love, and that
every sign of affection was permitted
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">præter stuprum</span></span>;<a id="noteref_1412" name="noteref_1412" href="#note_1412"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1412</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page306">[pg 306]</span><a name="Pg306" id="Pg306" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
for although in the times of the corruption of manners
this proximity would have been attended with the most
dangerous consequences, in early times it never would
have been permitted, if any pollution had been apprehended
from it. And we know from another source
that this <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">stuprum</span></span> was punished by the Lacedæmonians
most severely, viz. with banishment or death.<a id="noteref_1413" name="noteref_1413" href="#note_1413"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1413</span></span></a> It
may be moreover added, that this pure connexion was
encouraged by the Doric principle of taking the education
from the hands of parents, and introducing boys
in early youth to a wider society than their home could
afford.<a id="noteref_1414" name="noteref_1414" href="#note_1414"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1414</span></span></a>

as might be supposed, on a very artificial
system: indeed, the great number of classes into
which the boys and youths were distributed, would
itself lead us to this conclusion. For since this separation
could not have been made without some aim,
each class, we may conjecture, was treated in some
way different from the rest, the whole forming a complete
scale of mental or bodily acquirements.

4. Thus far respecting the arrangements for training
the youths. The education itself was partly
bodily, partly mental; although the division must not
be drawn too strictly, since each exercise of the body
includes at the same time that of the mind, at least of
its hardihood, patience, and vigour. The Greeks,
however, used the general terms of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">gymnastic</span></em> for the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page313">[pg 313]</span><a name="Pg313" id="Pg313" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
former, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">music</span></em> for the latter of these branches. It
is well known that the Dorians paid more attention
than any other Greeks to gymnastic exercises;<a id="noteref_1456" name="noteref_1456" href="#note_1456"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1456</span></span></a> and
it has been above remarked, that these exercises in
their proper sense first originated among the Cretans
and Spartans; the latter in particular have often been
censured for practising them in an immoderate degree.<a id="noteref_1457" name="noteref_1457" href="#note_1457"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1457</span></span></a>
This want of moderation, however, though it
occurred in later times, is never perceivable in the
maxims and ideas of the Dorians, who in this, as in
several other cases, knew how to set bounds to youthful
ardour, and check its pernicious effects. Aristotle
himself<a id="noteref_1458" name="noteref_1458" href="#note_1458"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1458</span></span></a> remarks concerning the Spartan education,
that it did not tend to form athletes, who considered
gymnastic exercises as the chief business of life; and
that the exercises tending to the beauty and elasticity
of the frame were accurately separated from those of
an opposite character, is shown by the absolute prohibition
of the rougher exercises of boxing and the
pancration;<a id="noteref_1459" name="noteref_1459" href="#note_1459"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1459</span></span></a> the latter being a mixture of wrestling
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page314">[pg 314]</span><a name="Pg314" id="Pg314" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and boxing, in which the fall of either party did not
decide the victory, but the most violent contest often
took place when the combatants were struggling on
the ground. The reason of this is said to be, that
in these alone an express confession of the defeated
party by the raising of the hand, served to put an end
to the contest; and that Lycurgus would not permit
such an avowal to his Spartans. But the real reason
is probably that stated above. On the other hand,
gladiators (ὁπλόμαχοι) who publicly exhibited their
skill in the use of arms, were not tolerated in Laconia,<a id="noteref_1460" name="noteref_1460" href="#note_1460"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1460</span></span></a> probably because the use of arms was thought too
serious for mere sport and display. Nevertheless the
colony of Cyrene adopted this custom from Mantinea
in Arcadia,<a id="noteref_1461" name="noteref_1461" href="#note_1461"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1461</span></span></a> under their legislator Demonax.<a id="noteref_1462" name="noteref_1462" href="#note_1462"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1462</span></span></a>

5. The Doric race, to whom the elevation of gymnastic
contests into great national festivals was principally
owing, were probably likewise the first who
introduced crowns in lieu of other prizes of victory.
The gymnastic combatants in Homer are excited by
real rewards; but from the advanced state of civilization
on which the Dorians stood in other respects,
it is probable that they also purified the exhibition
of bodily activity from all other motives than the love
of honour. The first crown was bestowed at Olympia,
and was gained in the seventh Olympiad by Daicles a
Dorian of Messenia.<a id="noteref_1463" name="noteref_1463" href="#note_1463"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1463</span></span></a> How much gymnastic exercises
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page315">[pg 315]</span><a name="Pg315" id="Pg315" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
were practised in the different Doric states, may be
collected from the extant catalogues of the conquerors
at the Olympian, and Pythian games: some conclusions
may even be drawn from an examination of
Corsini's Catalogue. This shows that the Spartans
never practised either boxing or the pancration,<a id="noteref_1464" name="noteref_1464" href="#note_1464"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1464</span></span></a> and
their principles were so generally recognized at the
Olympian games, over which they possessed great
influence, that boys were not till a very late period permitted
to contend in the pancration.<a id="noteref_1465" name="noteref_1465" href="#note_1465"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1465</span></span></a> On the other
hand, many conquerors in the race came from Sparta,
particularly between the 20th and 50th Olympiads:
besides numerous pentathli and wrestlers: amongst
the former Philombrotus (Olymp. 26-28.), amongst
the latter Hipposthenes (Olymp. 37-43.) and his
son Hetœmocles are distinguished by the number of
crowns gained at Olympia; the first victors in both
contests were also Lacedæmonians. Before the 9th
Olympiad, the Elean catalogues mention Messenians
in particular as victors in the race: from the 49th
Olympiad, the natives of Croton are conspicuous as
victors in the stadium; of these, Tisicrates and Astylus
occupy the whole period between the 71st and
75th Olympiads. At the same time the swift-footed
Phallys was thrice victorious at the Pythian games:
this champion was likewise the wonder of his age
in the pentathlon (a contest requiring extraordinary
activity), but particularly in the exercise of
leaping,<a id="noteref_1466" name="noteref_1466" href="#note_1466"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1466</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page316">[pg 316]</span><a name="Pg316" id="Pg316" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
being also a warrior and athlete. The gymnastic
training of the young Crotoniats at that time attained
the height of the development of the body in equal
beauty and strength; Croton was celebrated for its
beautiful boys and youths.<a id="noteref_1467" name="noteref_1467" href="#note_1467"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1467</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
During this period there existed at Croton a school
of wrestlers, the chief of whom was Milo, who from
the 62nd Olympiad was victorious in almost every one
of the four principal games, more frequently than any
other Greek. It was however whilst the philosophy of
Pythagoras directed the public institutions of Croton,
and influenced its manners, that this city outshone the
rest of Greece by its warriors and athletes.<a id="noteref_1468" name="noteref_1468" href="#note_1468"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1468</span></span></a> Milo
himself, the fabulous champion of posterity, was at
the same time a sage and hero. But the conquest of
Sybaris, the destruction of the Pythagorean league,
and the adoption of the Achæan constitution, soon put
an end to this system, and Croton, without suffering
any external change, lost at the end of the 75th
Olympiad the whole of her internal vigour. As the
athletes of this town followed in their choice of exercises
the fundamental principles of Spartan discipline,
the case was reversed amongst the Rhodians,
particularly whilst the family of Diagoras flourished,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page317">[pg 317]</span><a name="Pg317" id="Pg317" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

were famed for their dexterity in the contests,
and from the 45th Olympiad till the dissolution of
their state, bore off numerous victories in the race,
wrestling, and pancration, and were particularly distinguished
as boys.<a id="noteref_1470" name="noteref_1470" href="#note_1470"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1470</span></span></a> The distant colonies in Sicily

the latter expected more glory from their renowned
horses and chariots,<a id="noteref_1471" name="noteref_1471" href="#note_1471"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1471</span></span></a> the former from their breed of

in running, fought (according to Pindar,

6. But all the exercises in the gymnasium of
Sparta were esteemed of perhaps less importance to
the education of the body, than another class, the
object of which was to harden the frame by labour
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page318">[pg 318]</span><a name="Pg318" id="Pg318" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and fatigue. The body was obliged to undergo heat
and cold (the extremes of which were felt in an immoderate
degree throughout the narrow valley of
Sparta),<a id="noteref_1475" name="noteref_1475" href="#note_1475"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1475</span></span></a> likewise hunger, thirst and
privations of every description. To this they were trained by
frequent hunting on the mountains, in which manner
the youths of Crete were also exercised,<a id="noteref_1476" name="noteref_1476" href="#note_1476"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1476</span></span></a> as also in the

service in the most distant parts of the Laconian territory,
amidst which the young men of Sparta grew up
from youth to manhood, obliged to administer to their
own wants without the assistance of a servant.<a id="noteref_1478" name="noteref_1478" href="#note_1478"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1478</span></span></a> The
boys were also inured to hardships, by being forced to
obtain their daily nourishment by stealing; for this
custom was also limited to a particular period in the
education of the sons of the Equals.<a id="noteref_1479" name="noteref_1479" href="#note_1479"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1479</span></span></a> We
should certainly afford at the best but a very partial representation
of these peculiar customs, if we were to single
out some striking peculiarity from a connected system,
and attempt to examine in detail a subject which
should be criticised generally, or not at all. According
to the scattered fragments of our information, the
state of the case was as follows:<a id="noteref_1480" name="noteref_1480" href="#note_1480"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1480</span></span></a> the boys at a certain
period were generally banished from the town, and all
communion with men, and were obliged to lead a
wandering life in the fields and forests. When thus
excluded, they were forced to obtain, by force or cunning
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page319">[pg 319]</span><a name="Pg319" id="Pg319" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the means of subsistence from the houses and
court-yards, all access to which was at this time forbidden
them; frequently obliged to keep watch for
whole nights, and always exposed to the danger of
being beaten, if detected. To judge this custom with
fairness, it should only be regarded in the connexion
which we have explained above. The possession of
property was made to furnish a means of sharpening
the intellect, and strengthening the courage of the
citizens, by forcing the one party to hold and the other
to obtain it by a sort of war. The loss of property
which was thus occasioned, appeared of little importance
to a state where personal rights were so little
regarded; and the mischievous consequences were in
some measure avoided by an exact definition of the
goods permitted to be stolen,<a id="noteref_1481" name="noteref_1481" href="#note_1481"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1481</span></span></a> which were in fact those,
that any Spartan who required them for the chase,
might take from the stock of another. Such was the
idea upon which this usage was kept up; it might
possibly however have originated in the ancient
mountain-life of the Dorians, when they inhabited
mounts Œta and Olympus, cooped up within narrow
boundaries, and engaged in perpetual contests with
the more fortunate inhabitants of the plains: as a relic
and memorial of those habits, it remained, contrasted
with the independent and secure mode of life of the
Spartans at a later period. Respecting the triumph
of Spartan hardihood, viz. the scourging at the altar
of Artemis Orthia, it has been above remarked in what
manner, by a change made in the genuine Grecian
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page320">[pg 320]</span><a name="Pg320" id="Pg320" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
spirit, the gloomy rites of a sanguinary religion had
been turned to a different and useful purpose.<a id="noteref_1482" name="noteref_1482" href="#note_1482"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1482</span></span></a>

7. The gymnastic war-games, which were peculiar
to the Cretans and Spartans, still remained to be
noticed as a characteristic feature of the Doric education.
At the celebration of these, the ephebi, after
a sacrifice to Ares in a temple at Therapne, went
through a regular battle unarmed, in an island formed
by ditches, near the garden called Platanistas, and exerted
every means in their power to obtain the victory.<a id="noteref_1483" name="noteref_1483" href="#note_1483"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1483</span></span></a>
In Crete the boys belonging to one syssition frequently
engaged in battle against those of another, the youths
of one agele against those of another, and these contests
bore a still nearer resemblance to a real engagement.
They marched to the sound of flutes and lyres,
and besides fists, weapons of wood and iron were employed.<a id="noteref_1484" name="noteref_1484" href="#note_1484"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1484</span></span></a>
Yet although at Sparta gymnastic exercises
were certainly brought to a nearer resemblance with
war than in the rest of Greece, it would be erroneous
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page321">[pg 321]</span><a name="Pg321" id="Pg321" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
on that account to conclude, that the aim of all bodily
education among the Dorians was to obtain superiority
in war. Enough has been alleged to prove satisfactorily
to any unprejudiced reader, that the chief object
of Spartan discipline was to invigorate the bodies of
the youth, without rendering their minds at the same
time either brutal or ferocious. And that this endeavour
to attain, as it were, an ideal beauty and
strength of limb, was not altogether unsuccessful, may
be seen from the fact, that the Spartans, as well as
the Crotoniats, were about the 60th Olympiad (540
B.C.) the most healthy of the Greeks,<a id="noteref_1485" name="noteref_1485" href="#note_1485"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1485</span></span></a> and that the
most beautiful men as well as women were found
amongst them.<a id="noteref_1486" name="noteref_1486" href="#note_1486"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1486</span></span></a>

8. The female sex underwent in this respect the
same education as the male, though (as has been above
remarked) only the virgins. They had their own
gymnasia,<a id="noteref_1487" name="noteref_1487" href="#note_1487"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1487</span></span></a> and exercised themselves, either naked

or men were allowed to look on, since in the gymnasia

The whole system of gymnastic exercise was placed
at Sparta under the superintendence of magistrates of
the highest dignity, the bidiæi; and the ephors every
ten days inspected the condition of the boys, to ascertain

1. We are now about to speak of the history of
music in the different Doric states; and before we
notice particular facts and circumstances, we must
direct our attention to the more general one, namely,
that one of the musical <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">modes</span></em> or ἁρμονίαι (by which
term the ancient Greeks denoted the arrangement of
intervals, the length of which was fixed by the different
kinds of harmony, γένη, according to the strings of the
tetrachord, together with the higher or lower scale of
the whole system), was anciently called the
Doric,<a id="noteref_1493" name="noteref_1493" href="#note_1493"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1493</span></span></a>
and that this measure, together with the Phrygian and
Lydian, was long the only one in use among the
musicians of Greece, and consequently the only one
which in these early times derived its name from a
Greek nation; a sufficient warrant for us to consider it
as the genuine Greek mode, in contradistinction to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page324">[pg 324]</span><a name="Pg324" id="Pg324" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
any other introduced at a later period.<a id="noteref_1494" name="noteref_1494" href="#note_1494"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1494</span></span></a>
A question next arises, wherefore this ancient and genuine Greek
strain was called the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Doric</span></em>.<a id="noteref_1495" name="noteref_1495" href="#note_1495"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1495</span></span></a> The only explanation
that can be given is, that it was brought to perfection
in Doric countries, viz. in the ancient nurseries of
music, Crete, Sparta, Sicyon, and Delphi. There
cannot therefore have been any school or succession of
musicians among the other Greek nations, of greater
celebrity than the Doric, before the time we allude to.
Had this been the fact, they must either have adopted
the same mode, or had an original one of their own;
in the first case, it would have been named rather
after them, in preference to the Dorians; in the second,
there would have been <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">two</span></em> Greek musical modes, not
merely the Doric. It follows then, that the establishment
of the Doric music must have been of greater
antiquity than the renowned musicians of Lesbos, who
themselves were prior to Archilochus,<a id="noteref_1496" name="noteref_1496" href="#note_1496"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1496</span></span></a> and should not
be considered as commencing with Terpander<a id="noteref_1497" name="noteref_1497" href="#note_1497"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1497</span></span></a> (who
flourished from Olymp. 26. till 33. 676-646 B.C.),
since at his time they had already arrived at a high
degree of eminence. In fact, the Lesbian musicians
were at that time the most distinguished in Greece:
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page325">[pg 325]</span><a name="Pg325" id="Pg325" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
they far surpassed the native musicians of Peloponnesus,
nay, even of Lacedæmon itself; so that if the
above style had not at that time been common in the
Peninsula, it would not have been called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the Doric</span></em>.
Notwithstanding which, the opposition of the Doric
to the Phrygian and Lydian modes on the one side, and
the definite and systematic relation between the three
on the other, can neither have been the result of mere
popular and unscientific attempts, nor have originated
in the mother-country of Greece, where there was no
opportunity of becoming acquainted with the styles of
music peculiar to those Asiatic nations,<a id="noteref_1498" name="noteref_1498" href="#note_1498"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1498</span></span></a> or of comparing
them with their own, so as to mould them into one.
The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Doric</span></em> mode, however, could only have been so
named originally, from the contrast which it exhibited
with these other kinds of music, and this must have
been first observed in foreign countries, and not among
the Dorians or Peloponnesians themselves, who were
only acquainted with one style. The natural supposition
then is, that the Lesbian musicians, being in constant
communication both with Peloponnesus and Asia
Minor, first established the distinction and names of
the three <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">modes</span></em>, by adapting to the particular species
of tetrachord in use throughout Peloponnesus, the accompaniments
of singing and dancing practised in
Asia Minor, and moulding the whole into a regular
system.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<a name="Book_IV_Chapter_VI_Section_2" id="Book_IV_Chapter_VI_Section_2" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
2. Allowing then the truth of these premises, it
follows that the Dorians of Peloponnesus, the genuine
Greeks, cultivated music to a greater degree than
any other of the Grecian tribes, before the time when
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page326">[pg 326]</span><a name="Pg326" id="Pg326" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
this far-famed school of Asia flourished. We are
warranted in assuming that it was not merely the external
influence of the Doric race which gave their
name to this mode, from the close affinity it bears to
the character of the nation. The ancients, who were
infinitely quicker in discovering the moral character
of music than can be the case in modern times, attributed
to it something solemn, firm, and manly, calculated
to inspire fortitude in supporting misfortunes and
hardships, and to strengthen the mind against the
attacks of passion. They discovered in it a calm sublimity,
and a simple grandeur which bordered upon
severity, equally opposed to inconstancy and enthusiasm;<a id="noteref_1499" name="noteref_1499" href="#note_1499"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1499</span></span></a>
and this is precisely the character we find so
strongly impressed on the religion, arts, and manners
of the Dorians. The severity and rudeness of this
music (which appeared gloomy and harsh to the later
ages, and would be still more so to our ears, accustomed
to a softer style) was strikingly contrasted with
the mild and pleasing character which had then long
pervaded the Epic poetry. It teaches us undoubtedly
to distinguish between the Asiatic Greeks, and those
sprung from the mountains in the north of Greece,
who, proud of their natural loftiness of character and
vigour of mind, had acquired but little refinement from
any contact with strangers.

3. In the study of music, as well as every thing
else, the Dorians were uniformly the friends of antiquity;
and in this also Sparta was considered the
model of Doric customs.<a id="noteref_1500" name="noteref_1500" href="#note_1500"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1500</span></span></a> Not that Sparta opposed

herself altogether to every attempt at improvement;
her object was, that every novelty should be first acknowledged
to be an improvement, before it passed
into common use, and formed a part of the national
education. Hence it unavoidably followed, that the
music publicly practised in Sparta proceeded by rapid
and single advances to a state of perfection; which
opinion is perfectly consistent with the account given
by an ancient author of the different regulations
respecting the exercise of this art.<a id="noteref_1501" name="noteref_1501" href="#note_1501"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1501</span></span></a> When Terpander,
the son of Derdenes, an inhabitant of Antissa in
Lesbos, four times carried off the prize in the Pythian
games, and also in the Carnean festival at Sparta
(where the musicians of his school were long
distinguished),<a id="noteref_1502" name="noteref_1502" href="#note_1502"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1502</span></span></a>
and had tranquillized the tumults and disorders
of the city by the solemn and healing tones
of his songs,<a id="noteref_1503" name="noteref_1503" href="#note_1503"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1503</span></span></a> the acknowledged admiration of this
master became so general in Sparta, that he procured
the sanction of the law to his new inventions, particularly
the seven-stringed cithara. It appears that by
these means<a id="noteref_1504" name="noteref_1504" href="#note_1504"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1504</span></span></a> the music of earlier times became entirely
antiquated, so that with the exception of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page328">[pg 328]</span><a name="Pg328" id="Pg328" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
ancient Pythian minstrels, Chrysothemis and Philammon,
not one name of the Doric musicians, before the
time of Terpander, has come down to us. For those
who, like Thaletas, have been sometimes considered
more ancient, belong, according to undoubted testimony,
to a later period.<a id="noteref_1505" name="noteref_1505" href="#note_1505"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1505</span></span></a> Plutarch dates the second
epoch of Spartan music from Thaletas the Elyrian
(whose skill was undoubtedly derived from the ancient
sacred minstrels of the neighbouring town of Tarrha),<a id="noteref_1506" name="noteref_1506" href="#note_1506"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1506</span></span></a> and from Xenodamus of Cythera, and Xenocritus the
Locrian,<a id="noteref_1507" name="noteref_1507" href="#note_1507"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1507</span></span></a> (whose chief compositions were pæans and
hyporchemes), from Polymnestus of Colophon, and
Sacadas the Argive, the latter of whom distinguished
himself in elegies and other compositions adapted to
the flute, the former in the orthian and dithyrambic
styles, and also as an epic and elegiac poet. Sacadas
flourished and conquered at the Pythian games in
Olymp. 48. 3. 586 B.C.; the other musicians, according
to Plutarch, must also have lived about the same
period. Thaletas was however earlier than Polymnestus<a id="noteref_1508" name="noteref_1508" href="#note_1508"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1508</span></span></a>
and Xenocritus,<a id="noteref_1509" name="noteref_1509" href="#note_1509"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1509</span></span></a> although later than Terpander

and Archilochus, and therefore lived before the 40th
Olympiad, or 620 B.C. To these musicians Plutarch
entirely ascribes the introduction of songs at the
gymnopædia of Lacedæmon,<a id="noteref_1510" name="noteref_1510" href="#note_1510"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1510</span></span></a> the endymatia at Argos,
and some public spectacles in Arcadia. The regulations
established at this period appear to have continued
in force as long as the Spartan customs were
kept up, and were the chief means by which the
changes attempted to be introduced during the several
epochs of Melanippides, Cinesias, Phrynis, and Timotheus
the Milesian were prevented from being carried
into effect. Thus Ecprepes the ephor, on observing
that the cithara of Phrynis had two strings more than
the allowed number, immediately cut them out; and
the<a id="noteref_1511" name="noteref_1511" href="#note_1511"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1511</span></span></a> same thing is said to have happened to Timotheus

contradicted by an improbable story, that the accused
minstrel justified himself by referring to a statue of
Apollo at Sparta, which had a lyre containing the
same number of strings.<a id="noteref_1513" name="noteref_1513" href="#note_1513"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1513</span></span></a> At least Pausanias<a id="noteref_1514" name="noteref_1514" href="#note_1514"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1514</span></span></a> saw in

perform at the festival of the Eleusian Ceres, he
exhibited an indecent representation of the holy
rites, and most improperly instructed the young
men in the mystery of the labour-pains of Semele;
it is decreed that the kings and ephors should reprimand
Timotheus, and compel him to reduce the
number of strings on his cithara to seven; in order
that every person in future, being conscious of the
dignity of the state, might beware of introducing
improper customs into Sparta, and the fame of the
contests be preserved unsullied.”</span><a id="noteref_1517" name="noteref_1517" href="#note_1517"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1517</span></span></a> But the authenticity
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page331">[pg 331]</span><a name="Pg331" id="Pg331" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the inscription is so doubtful, to say no more,
that we dare not deduce any historical inferences from
it. For in the first place, the style of the document
appears to have been formed upon the model of a
common Athenian honorary decree, only that censure
is inserted instead of praise with a sort of mock gravity.
There is nothing in it characteristic of Spartan
manners, but much that is foreign and almost strange;
for example, it is not even stated who proposed and
approved the decree. Secondly, a decree upon such
a subject is not consistent with the general spirit of
the government of Sparta, which was distinguished
by its summary method of proceeding. Every ephor,
as inspector of the games, had the same powers individually
as are here attributed to the whole college,
and the kings; who had (it is true) a place of honour
at the public games, but no share in the direction of
them. The Eleusinia, in the form of a theatrical festival,
were at least celebrated in Sparta at a late date.<a id="noteref_1518" name="noteref_1518" href="#note_1518"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1518</span></span></a> That Timotheus should have ventured to produce his
<span class="tei tei-q">“Birth of Bacchus”</span> at those games is very surprising;
but still more so is the account of his having
taught it to the Spartan youths, which can only mean
that he contrived to have it represented by the young
men of the town. Now the Ὠδὶν of Timotheus was
a dithyrambic ode of the mimic species, which was a
late invention performed by regular actors, not by a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page332">[pg 332]</span><a name="Pg332" id="Pg332" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
public chorus. How then is it possible that the
latter should have been the case at Sparta? The
learned distinction between different styles of music
in the decree, clearly savours less of Laconian brevity
than of the self-complacency of some grammarian.<a id="noteref_1519" name="noteref_1519" href="#note_1519"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1519</span></span></a>
Most of the expressions used may be traced to the
comic poets of Athens, and contain no Spartan peculiarities,
and yet an accurate explanation of them
might lead us into many difficulties. Lastly, the
dialect appears to me to be the composition of some
one who had accidentally become acquainted with
peculiar Spartan inflections. The letter Ρ is most
suspiciously used throughout; the author had evidently
an erroneous notion that Θ is not Laconian,
and should be changed into Τ, instead of Σ.<a id="noteref_1520" name="noteref_1520" href="#note_1520"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1520</span></span></a> The
editors have endeavoured to make considerable alterations
in the orthography;<a id="noteref_1521" name="noteref_1521" href="#note_1521"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1521</span></span></a> but by this means all possibility
of criticism is made hopeless. It is therefore
probable that some grammarian has taken the trouble
to draw up a Laconian decree from one of the stories
respecting Timotheus, the interest of which should
consist in the austerity of the sentiments, and the
roughness of the dialect. That the inventor really
intended it for a public monument, is evident from the
ancient style of writing, which was abolished at Athens
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page333">[pg 333]</span><a name="Pg333" id="Pg333" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
at the archonship of Euclid, and in Sparta perhaps
later.<a id="noteref_1522" name="noteref_1522" href="#note_1522"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1522</span></span></a>

In Crete the national music was once formed on
the same principles as in Lacedæmon,<a id="noteref_1523" name="noteref_1523" href="#note_1523"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1523</span></span></a> but became

4. The chief reason why the state constantly interfered
in the regulation of music was, that it was considered
much more as expressing the general tone of
the feeling and morals of the people, than as an art
which might be left to its own capabilities of improvement.
Historical examples confirm the truth of this
close connexion, and in particular, it is alleged respecting
the Dorians of Sicily, that by introducing
a soft effeminate music, they destroyed the purity
of their morals;<a id="noteref_1528" name="noteref_1528" href="#note_1528"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1528</span></span></a> while the strict domestic discipline
at Sparta would hardly have been preserved without
the assistance of the ancient style of music which was
there cultivated. In order to explain this, it is necessary
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page334">[pg 334]</span><a name="Pg334" id="Pg334" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to observe, that in those times music formed a
much more universal branch of education, and was
practised to a far greater extent by the people at large,
than it has ever been since.<a id="noteref_1529" name="noteref_1529" href="#note_1529"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1529</span></span></a> We may trace the progress
of music, as it from time to time fell more into
the hands of individual artists, whilst the populace,
which in the infancy of the art took a part in the exhibition,
gradually became mere spectators. The command
of an ancient Delphic oracle,<a id="noteref_1530" name="noteref_1530" href="#note_1530"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1530</span></span></a> that public
thanksgivings should be offered to Bromius by the
whole people for a fruitful year, by singing choruses
in the streets, was also followed at Sparta, at least in
the Gymnopædia. At this festival large choruses of
men and boys appeared,<a id="noteref_1531" name="noteref_1531" href="#note_1531"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1531</span></span></a> in which many of the inhabitants
of the city doubtless took part. From this
circumstance either the whole or part of the market
was called <span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">chorus</span></span>;<a id="noteref_1532" name="noteref_1532" href="#note_1532"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1532</span></span></a> and it is probable that the spacious
(εὐρύχοροι) cities of Homer were merely furnished
with open squares large enough to contain such numerous
choruses. It was at these great city choruses
that those of blemished reputation always
occupied the hindermost rows:<a id="noteref_1533" name="noteref_1533" href="#note_1533"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1533</span></span></a> sometimes, nevertheless,
men of consideration, when placed there by the
arranger of the chorus, boasted that they did honour
to the places, the places did not dishonour them.<a id="noteref_1534" name="noteref_1534" href="#note_1534"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1534</span></span></a>

Those placed at the back of the chorus were called
(like the soldiers arrayed behind the line of battle)
ψιλεῖς;<a id="noteref_1535" name="noteref_1535" href="#note_1535"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1535</span></span></a> the choregus, however, did not merely defray
the expenses of the chorus, but he also led it in person;
and indeed a choregos once performed the duties
of flute-player at Lacedæmon.<a id="noteref_1536" name="noteref_1536" href="#note_1536"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1536</span></span></a> If
then every citizen took some part in these choruses, it follows that they
must have been trained to them, and have practised
them from childhood; as we know on the other hand
that the whole musical instruction of Crete and
Sparta was intended as a preparation for them.<a id="noteref_1537" name="noteref_1537" href="#note_1537"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1537</span></span></a> Accordingly, the musical school was called

was a constant reference to the public choral dances.
Hence we perceive that, at least in early times, a certain
cultivation of music within the limits prescribed
by the national manners was common to all Spartans;
and the saying of the poet Socrates,<a id="noteref_1539" name="noteref_1539" href="#note_1539"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1539</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“that the bravest
of the Greeks also made the finest choruses,”</span> was
peculiarly applicable to them; also Pratinas the scenic
poet speaks of <span class="tei tei-q">“the Lacedæmonian cicada,<a id="noteref_1540" name="noteref_1540" href="#note_1540"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1540</span></span></a> as ready for

numbers of the citizens in Sparta so greatly diminished, and war
occupied so much of the public attention, that the
favourable side of Spartan discipline was cast into the
shade, and Aristotle ascribes with truth to the Spartans
of his time a just discrimination and taste for music,
but no scientific knowledge of it.<a id="noteref_1542" name="noteref_1542" href="#note_1542"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1542</span></span></a>

The cultivation of music, however, was the more
general among the Dorians and kindred race of
Arcadians, from the circumstance that women took a
part in it, and sang and danced in public both with
men and by themselves.<a id="noteref_1543" name="noteref_1543" href="#note_1543"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1543</span></span></a> On the nature of the

with confidence, when we are told, that the parthenia
were accompanied by Dorian music, and there was
something in them exceedingly grave and solemn.<a id="noteref_1544" name="noteref_1544" href="#note_1544"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1544</span></span></a> It
appears likewise, that aged persons, who at Athens
would have been ridiculed for dancing at religious
ceremonies, at Sparta often took a part in the great
choruses, as is proved by the accounts of the three
great choirs of boys, men, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">old men</span></em>, which seem
to have danced at several great festivals.<a id="noteref_1545" name="noteref_1545" href="#note_1545"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1545</span></span></a>

5. Having now in the foregoing remarks considered
the peculiarities of the Doric race, as well in general
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page337">[pg 337]</span><a name="Pg337" id="Pg337" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
as with respect to Sparta in particular, we shall next
give some account of the progress of music among the
several states of that race.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
That the religious music and poetry of the Dorians
originated in Crete, has been shown above:<a id="noteref_1546" name="noteref_1546" href="#note_1546"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1546</span></span></a> and
perhaps the loud and irregular music of the early
Phrygian inhabitants first awakened a taste for that
art among the Dorians. The nome, the pæan, and
the hyporcheme,<a id="noteref_1547" name="noteref_1547" href="#note_1547"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1547</span></span></a> had been known in Crete from an
early period, though the more polished form of the
two last was introduced by Thaletas. The dances in
a ring were often connected with the nome and hyporcheme,
according to an ancient custom in Crete and
the neighbouring regions; and they were danced by
both men and women.<a id="noteref_1548" name="noteref_1548" href="#note_1548"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1548</span></span></a> At Sparta there were the
same dancers, known by the name of ῥμοι, or
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ornaments</span></em>.<a id="noteref_1549" name="noteref_1549" href="#note_1549"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1549</span></span></a>
The youth danced first some movements
suited to his age, and of a military nature; the maiden
followed in measured steps, and with feminine gestures.
The Spartan music was in general derived
from the Cretan, nor did it attempt to disown its
origin; indeed many favourite dances, with their
tunes, and certain pæans, ordered by law to be sung
at appointed times, together with many other kinds
of music, were called Cretan.<a id="noteref_1550" name="noteref_1550" href="#note_1550"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1550</span></span></a> But it cannot be
denied that, although their origin may have been
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page338">[pg 338]</span><a name="Pg338" id="Pg338" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
similar, their progress and development were very
different. The Cretan music appears to have been
almost entirely warlike and religious, while the
Spartan, from the time of Alcman, was adapted to

dances were in existence at the time of Cleisthenes
of Sicyon;<a id="noteref_1551" name="noteref_1551" href="#note_1551"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1551</span></span></a> they consisted both of motions

music in these regions is shown by the contests in
the temple of Zeus at Ithome in Messenia, in which
Eumelus engaged before the first war with Lacedæmon:<a id="noteref_1553" name="noteref_1553" href="#note_1553"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1553</span></span></a> the contests of the Muses connected with
the Carnean festival began in the 26th Olympiad

the most celebrated musicians in Greece,<a id="noteref_1554" name="noteref_1554" href="#note_1554"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1554</span></span></a>
particularly flute-players; about the 48th Olympiad
(588 B.C.) Sacadas wrote poetry, composed music,
and played lyric songs and elegies to the flute:<a id="noteref_1555" name="noteref_1555" href="#note_1555"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1555</span></span></a> a particular kind of

also appears to have had a share in these improvements:
for after Sacadas had thrice gained the
prize, Pythocritus of Sicyon was victorious in six
following contests;<a id="noteref_1557" name="noteref_1557" href="#note_1557"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1557</span></span></a> and the dithyrambic

6. We do not intend to consider the subject of
dancing independently of music; as this combination
appears to be most convenient for our purpose of
ascertaining its importance as connected with manners
and public education. Dancing, when it did
not merely accompany the time of the music, inclined
either to gymnastic display or to mimicry;
that is, it either represented bodily activity, or it
was meant to express certain ideas and feelings.
The gymnastic dancing was no where so much
practised as at Sparta, where the ancient connexion
between the musical school and the palæstra, and of
both with the military exercises,<a id="noteref_1564" name="noteref_1564" href="#note_1564"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1564</span></span></a> was more strictly
maintained than in any other state. Indeed the march
of the Spartans and Cretans had, on account of its
musical accompaniment, some resemblance to a dance.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page340">[pg 340]</span><a name="Pg340" id="Pg340" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
For, whereas the other Greeks either marched to
battle without any music, in the manner of the
ancient Achæans, or, like the Argives, made use of
Tyrrhenian trumpets,<a id="noteref_1565" name="noteref_1565" href="#note_1565"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1565</span></span></a> the Cretans advanced to battle
to the sound of the lyre,<a id="noteref_1566" name="noteref_1566" href="#note_1566"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1566</span></span></a> the Spartans to that of the
flute.<a id="noteref_1567" name="noteref_1567" href="#note_1567"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1567</span></span></a> This last seems, however, to have been an
innovation; for Alcman the Laconian mentions the
cithara;<a id="noteref_1568" name="noteref_1568" href="#note_1568"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1568</span></span></a> and the Cretans also introduced the flute in
their army.<a id="noteref_1569" name="noteref_1569" href="#note_1569"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1569</span></span></a> However, be this as it may, the flute had
become the common instrument at Sparta; probably
because the cithara was not fitted for uniting large
bodies of men, its sound being too low to produce any
effect, even during a complete stillness. The sound
of flutes was doubtless more piercing, and particularly
when a great number of pipers (who in Sparta formed
several native
families)<a id="noteref_1570" name="noteref_1570" href="#note_1570"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1570</span></span></a>
played the tune for attack.
Thucydides remarks that this was not for any religious
purpose, but that the troops might march in time,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page341">[pg 341]</span><a name="Pg341" id="Pg341" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and not as large armies are apt to do, fall into disorder.<a id="noteref_1571" name="noteref_1571" href="#note_1571"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1571</span></span></a>
The general term for a tune of this kind was
<span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">embaterion</span></span>.<a id="noteref_1572" name="noteref_1572" href="#note_1572"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1572</span></span></a>
One kind of nome was called <span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">castoreum</span></span>,
which, like the others, was played on the flute, when
the army marched in line to meet the enemy.<a id="noteref_1573" name="noteref_1573" href="#note_1573"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1573</span></span></a> This
had the same rhythm<a id="noteref_1574" name="noteref_1574" href="#note_1574"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1574</span></span></a> as
the other embateria,<a id="noteref_1575" name="noteref_1575" href="#note_1575"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1575</span></span></a> viz. an
anapæstic; both in its measure and melody there was
something very enlivening and animated,<a id="noteref_1576" name="noteref_1576" href="#note_1576"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1576</span></span></a> so that
Alexander of Macedon always felt himself inspired
with fresh bravery when Timotheus the Theban played
the castoreum to him. There can be no doubt that it
was originally set in the Doric mode, and bore the
character of Spartan simplicity, notwithstanding the
many variations which were afterwards added.<a id="noteref_1577" name="noteref_1577" href="#note_1577"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1577</span></span></a> Pindar

the most ancient use of this nome, as a march for the
Spartans, could have to this point: but it clearly took
its name from the Tyndaridæ, who were considered as
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page342">[pg 342]</span><a name="Pg342" id="Pg342" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the leaders of the Spartan army.<a id="noteref_1579" name="noteref_1579" href="#note_1579"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1579</span></span></a> That of the poems

at meals, and after the pæan, not in chorus, but singly,
and for a prize. The polemarch
decided,<a id="noteref_1581" name="noteref_1581" href="#note_1581"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1581</span></span></a> and the

a musician.<a id="noteref_1583" name="noteref_1583" href="#note_1583"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1583</span></span></a>

7. That war among these ancient nations had
something of an imitative nature, and that it was by
imperceptible transitions connected with the pure
imitations of art, I have already attempted to
show;<a id="noteref_1584" name="noteref_1584" href="#note_1584"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1584</span></span></a>
and the same may be inferred from what has been
just said. A transition of this kind was formed by
the Pyrrhic dance, the dancers of which bore the same
name as the practised, armed and expert combatant
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page343">[pg 343]</span><a name="Pg343" id="Pg343" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
(πρύλις).<a id="noteref_1585" name="noteref_1585" href="#note_1585"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1585</span></span></a> The Pyrrhic dance was undoubtedly a
production of the Doric nation in Crete and Sparta,<a id="noteref_1586" name="noteref_1586" href="#note_1586"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1586</span></span></a>
although in the former state it was fabulously connected
with the Curetes and the rites of the ancient
Idæan Zeus,<a id="noteref_1587" name="noteref_1587" href="#note_1587"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1587</span></span></a> and at Sparta with the Dioscuri. It
was danced to the flute,<a id="noteref_1588" name="noteref_1588" href="#note_1588"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1588</span></span></a> and its time was very quick
and light, as is shown by the name of the Pyrrhic
foot. Hence in Crete Thaletas was able to add
hyporchematic or mimic variations to it,<a id="noteref_1589" name="noteref_1589" href="#note_1589"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1589</span></span></a>
which had likewise quick measures. From this account it may
be also inferred that the war-dance of Crete was of an
imitative kind; and indeed Plato says of the Pyrrhic
dance in general that it imitated all the attitudes of
defence, by avoiding a thrust or a cast, retreating,
springing up, and crouching, as also the opposite
movements of attack with arrows and lances, and also
of every kind of thrust.<a id="noteref_1590" name="noteref_1590" href="#note_1590"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1590</span></span></a> So strong was the
attachment to this dance at Sparta, that, long after it had in
the other Greek states degenerated into a Bacchanalian
revel, it was still danced by the Spartans
as a warlike exercise, and boys of fifteen were instructed
in it.<a id="noteref_1591" name="noteref_1591" href="#note_1591"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1591</span></span></a>

8. But we must return to the subject whence we
digressed, the connexion between gymnastic exercises
and dancing. These two arts were connected
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page344">[pg 344]</span><a name="Pg344" id="Pg344" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
by the pentathlon, a pattern of adroitness, activity,
strength and measured motions, which was accompanied
by the music of the flute.<a id="noteref_1592" name="noteref_1592" href="#note_1592"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1592</span></span></a> In later times any
tunes were used for this exhibition; but earlier certain
fixed measures were played, one of which had been
composed by Hierax, a disciple of Olympus:<a id="noteref_1593" name="noteref_1593" href="#note_1593"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1593</span></span></a> nor at
that time did distinguished artists disdain to appear as
actors in these sports, as, for example, Pythocritus of
Sicyon. At Argos, at the Sthenia, the combatants
wrestled to the sound of the flute;<a id="noteref_1594" name="noteref_1594" href="#note_1594"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1594</span></span></a> and a
melody of this same Hierax was played<a id="noteref_1595" name="noteref_1595" href="#note_1595"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1595</span></span></a> when the women carried
flowers (at a festival) to the temple of Here. At
Sparta the chief object of the Gymnopædia was to
represent gymnastic exercises and dancing in intimate
union, and indeed the latter only as the accomplishment
and end of the former. One of the principal
games at this festival resembled the <span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">anapale</span></span>,
or wrestling-dance; the boys danced in regular time
with graceful motions of the hands, in which the
methods of the wrestling-school and the pancration
were shown; at the same time, however, this dance
had some mixture of the Bacchanalian kind.<a id="noteref_1596" name="noteref_1596" href="#note_1596"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1596</span></span></a> Thus
also the youths (ephebi) of Sparta, when they were
skilled in their exercises, danced in rows behind each
other, to the music of the flute, first military, then
choral dances, and at the same time repeated two
verses, of which one was an invitation to Aphrodite
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page345">[pg 345]</span><a name="Pg345" id="Pg345" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and Eros to join them, the other an exhortation to one
another.<a id="noteref_1597" name="noteref_1597" href="#note_1597"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1597</span></span></a> There was also a dance with a ball at

were given to the most skilful; and we are told by a

any other had done.<a id="noteref_1601" name="noteref_1601" href="#note_1601"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1601</span></span></a> Besides the Bibasis the
<span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">Dipodia</span></span>
is mentioned;<a id="noteref_1602" name="noteref_1602" href="#note_1602"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1602</span></span></a> but so little is known about it, that the

Aristophanes a chorus of Lacedæmonians danced a
Dipodia to the flute, and sing, chiefly in trochaic
metre, of the battles of Thermopylæ and Artemisium,
and the friendship of Sparta and Athens;
after which follows another song, which was probably
danced in the same manner. In this the
chorus implores the Laconian Muse to come from
mount Taygetus, and to celebrate the tutelar deities
of Sparta; and urges itself to the dance in words
which give a very good idea of its character: <span class="tei tei-q">“Come
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page346">[pg 346]</span><a name="Pg346" id="Pg346" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
hither with a light motion to sing of Sparta. Where
there are choruses in honour of the gods, and the
noise of dancing, when, like young horses, the
maidens on the banks of the Eurotas rapidly move
their feet; while their hair floats, like revelling
Bacchanals; and the daughter of Leda directs them,
the sacred leader of the chorus. Now bind up the
hair, and leap like fawns; now strike the measured
tune which gladdens the chorus.”</span><a id="noteref_1604" name="noteref_1604" href="#note_1604"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1604</span></span></a>

9. We now come to the dances whose object was
to express and represent some peculiar meaning.
This was either some feeling (to which class almost
all the religious as well as the theatrical dances
belong) or some outward object; to which we may
refer the mimic dances. To the latter, the Pyrrhic
and the Gymnopædian dances belong, and to the religious,
the Hyporcheme, which we treated of in connexion
with the worship of Apollo.<a id="noteref_1606" name="noteref_1606" href="#note_1606"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1606</span></span></a> Of this

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page347">[pg 347]</span><a name="Pg347" id="Pg347" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Artemis and Apollo, danced by women, or, as some
assert, by men in hideous women's masks, who at the
same time sang hymns to the two deities.<a id="noteref_1608" name="noteref_1608" href="#note_1608"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1608</span></span></a> The name
signifies a violent leap; and from what we can gather
elsewhere respecting the character of this dance, it
appears to have been irregular and licentious. How
it agrees with the worship of Apollo, one does not
exactly perceive, unless it is supposed that some fable
in the history of that god was represented in a mimic
style, which admitted of such irregularity. The
worship of Artemis, however, had other forms which
produced these licentious dances, as in Laconia itself
the Calabis.<a id="noteref_1609" name="noteref_1609" href="#note_1609"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1609</span></span></a>

from the conclusion, were Laconian. The Hypogypones
imitated old men with sticks. The Gypones
danced on wooden stilts, and wearing
transparent Tarentine dresses. The Menes was
danced by Charini,<a id="noteref_1612" name="noteref_1612" href="#note_1612"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1612</span></span></a> and took its name from the
flute-player who invented it. There was a Bacchanalian
dance called <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Tyrbasia</span></span>,”</span> probably resembling
the Argive Tyrbè, and deriving its name from
its intricate mazes. <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">A dance in which they mimicked

exhibition, which produced all these mimic dances, is
shown in these imperfect notices, the deficiencies of
which we can only supply in one instance, viz. in the
account of the Deicelictæ (or Mimeli). There was at
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page349">[pg 349]</span><a name="Pg349" id="Pg349" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Sparta an ancient play, but it was probably acted only

by regular players.<a id="noteref_1613" name="noteref_1613" href="#note_1613"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1613</span></span></a> From the account of Nepos it
may be also conjectured that it was performed by
unmarried women. The name Deicelictæ (or Mimeli)
merely means <span class="tei tei-q">“imitators;”</span><a id="noteref_1614" name="noteref_1614" href="#note_1614"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1614</span></span></a> but it came to

in all things loved simplicity. It represented in plain
and common language either a foreign physician or
stealers of fruit (probably boys), who were caught
with their stolen goods;<a id="noteref_1617" name="noteref_1617" href="#note_1617"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1617</span></span></a> that is, it was an imitation of
common life, probably alternating with comic dances.

10. In Laconia it was chiefly the lower orders who
had any decided love for comedy and buffoonery; for
with the Dorians we only now and then discover a ray
of levity or mirth piercing the gravity of their nature.
I have already
mentioned,<a id="noteref_1618" name="noteref_1618" href="#note_1618"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1618</span></span></a> that from the Helots, who
dwelt in the houses of the Spartans, and were called
Mothones, or Mothaces, a kind of riotous dance took
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page350">[pg 350]</span><a name="Pg350" id="Pg350" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
its name, in which drunken persons were probably
represented; whence perhaps was derived the story
that the Spartans intoxicated their slaves as a warning
to their children. Other dances may perhaps have
been common among the peasants, and particularly
among the shepherds of remote regions.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is an interesting question, and one allied to the
present inquiry, to ascertain the origin of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">bucolic</span></em>
poetry of the ancients. No one can doubt that its
mingled character of simplicity, nature, and buffoonery,
was copied from real life. Now the manners which it
represented could neither have been those of slaves,
for the condition of slavery does not admit of any regular
society; nor yet of free citizens, for the rustic
scenes of this poetry wholly disagree with a city life.
It remains therefore that it imitated the life of subjects,
of bondmen, such as existed as a separate class
in the Doric states, and accordingly bucolic poems are
commonly in the Doric dialect. It is related, that
when Xerxes had overrun Greece, and the Spartan
women could not perform the customary rites of Artemis
Caryatis, the shepherds came from the mountains,
and sang pastoral hymns to the goddess.<a id="noteref_1619" name="noteref_1619" href="#note_1619"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1619</span></span></a> From this
confused account we may collect that in the north of
Laconia there had been some rude essays of pastoral
poetry. In this respect, however, the shepherds of
Italy and Sicily have become far more celebrated;
Epicharmus mentions their bucolics (βουκολιασμοὶ),
as a kind of dance and song;<a id="noteref_1620" name="noteref_1620" href="#note_1620"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1620</span></span></a> and even before his time
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page351">[pg 351]</span><a name="Pg351" id="Pg351" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Stesichorus had formed them into a species of lyric
poetry.<a id="noteref_1621" name="noteref_1621" href="#note_1621"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1621</span></span></a> Nevertheless their origin appears not
to have been independent of one another, for both in
Laconia and Sicily the name of Tityrus was used for
the leading goat or ram of the flock.<a id="noteref_1622" name="noteref_1622" href="#note_1622"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1622</span></span></a> That the
same name should equally distinguish the human and
animal leader of the flock, is a trait of the simplicity
of those men, who passed their days among valleys
and pastures, harmlessly tending their flocks, and
taking no more notice of other modes of life than
sending from time to time the produce of their industry
to the city. Now in Sicily these shepherds were not
of Greek extraction, but were undoubtedly of the
aboriginal Siculian population, the ancient worshippers
of the goddess Pales;<a id="noteref_1623" name="noteref_1623" href="#note_1623"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1623</span></span></a> and it is not improbable that
the bucolic poetry owed its origin to native talent.
Even the ancient legend of Daphnis, who lost his eyes
through his love for a nymph,<a id="noteref_1624" name="noteref_1624" href="#note_1624"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1624</span></span></a> appears to me rather
of a Siculian than Grecian cast; although how far the
character of the Greeks and of the native inhabitants
were opposed, is a very obscure subject of inquiry.<a id="noteref_1625" name="noteref_1625" href="#note_1625"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1625</span></span></a>

11. To conclude; as in Attica, so among the Dorians,
comedy connected itself with the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">country festivals</span></span>
of Bacchus; and, as Aristotle says,<a id="noteref_1626" name="noteref_1626" href="#note_1626"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1626</span></span></a> originated
from the extemporaneous songs of those who led the
Phallic processions, which were still customary in
many Greek cities at the time of that philosopher.
Of this, Sicyon furnishes an example. There was
there a dance called Ἀλητὴρ,<a id="noteref_1627" name="noteref_1627" href="#note_1627"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1627</span></span></a> which was probably of
a Phallic nature; and also a comic entertainment,
called the Phallophori,<a id="noteref_1628" name="noteref_1628" href="#note_1628"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1628</span></span></a> in which the actors, with their
heads and faces adorned with flowers, but unmasked,
came into the theatre, in stately garments, some at the
common entrance, some at the scene-doors; the Phallophorus,
his face smeared with soot, walked first from
among them, and, after giving notice that they came
with a new song in honour of Bacchus, they began to
ridicule any person they chose to select. Thus too the
Phlyaces of Tarentum were probably connected with
the worship of Bacchus, whose festivals were accompanied
with similar rejoicings in Sicily.<a id="noteref_1629" name="noteref_1629" href="#note_1629"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1629</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Yet the rites of Demeter sometimes gave rise among
the Dorians to lascivious entertainments of this kind,
as we learn from the description in Herodotus of the
Æginetan choruses of women at the festival of Artemis
and Auxesia, which provoked others of their sex
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page353">[pg 353]</span><a name="Pg353" id="Pg353" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
by riotous and insulting language.<a id="noteref_1630" name="noteref_1630" href="#note_1630"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1630</span></span></a> These
mockeries were, however, only the humour of the moment, and
were merely accessaries to certain dances and songs;
but among the Megarians, comedy, we know not by
what means, obtained a more artificial character, and
a more independent form.

1. At Athens, a coarse and ill-mannered jest was
termed a Megarian joke;<a id="noteref_1631" name="noteref_1631" href="#note_1631"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1631</span></span></a> which may be considered
as a certain proof of the decided propensity of that
people to humour. This is confirmed by the claims
of the Megarians, who disputed the invention of
comedy with the Athenians,<a id="noteref_1632" name="noteref_1632" href="#note_1632"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1632</span></span></a> and perhaps not without
justice, if indeed the term invention be at all applicable
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page354">[pg 354]</span><a name="Pg354" id="Pg354" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to the rise of the several branches of poetry,
which sprung so gradually, and at such different
times, from the particular feelings excited by the
ancient festival rites, that it is difficult, and perhaps
impossible, to fix upon the period at which the species
of composition to which each gave rise was sufficiently
advanced to be called a particular kind of poetry.
Yet it is in the highest degree probable that the
Athenians were indebted for the earliest form of their
comic poetry to the Megarians. The Megarian
comedy is ridiculed by Ecphantides, one of the early
comic poets of Athens, as rude and unpolished, which
circumstance alone makes its higher antiquity probable.<a id="noteref_1633" name="noteref_1633" href="#note_1633"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1633</span></span></a>
Ecphantides, whom Aristophanes, Cratinus,
and others, ridicule as rough and unpolished,<a id="noteref_1634" name="noteref_1634" href="#note_1634"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1634</span></span></a> looks
down in his turn on those who had introduced comedy
from Megara, and claims the merit of first seasoning
the uncouth Megarian productions with Attic salt.
But one of the earliest introducers of comedy was,
according to the most credible and authentic accounts,
Susarion, a native of Tripodiscus, an ancient village
in the Megarian territory;<a id="noteref_1635" name="noteref_1635" href="#note_1635"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1635</span></span></a> in Attica he made his
first appearance in the village of Icaria,<a id="noteref_1636" name="noteref_1636" href="#note_1636"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1636</span></span></a> situated on
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page355">[pg 355]</span><a name="Pg355" id="Pg355" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the borders of Megaris and Bœotia;<a id="noteref_1637" name="noteref_1637" href="#note_1637"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1637</span></span></a> where it is
known from mythological fables, that the rural festival
of Bacchus had been celebrated from an early period.
The argument for its Doric origin, derived from the
name κωμῳδία, <span class="tei tei-q">“the village-song”</span> (the Peloponnesians
calling their villages κῶμαι, and the Athenians
δῆμοι), is by no means conclusive, as the
derivation of that name from the word κῶμος, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a tumultuous
festival procession</span></span>, is far more probable.
The early time at which comedy must have flourished
may be seen from the fact, that it passed over to
Athens in the 50th Olympiad;<a id="noteref_1638" name="noteref_1638" href="#note_1638"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1638</span></span></a> but of its character
we should form a very partial judgment, if we trusted
implicitly to the accounts of the Athenian neighbours;
and yet we have no other means of information.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The ancient comedy of Susarion, and of the Megarians,
was (as is clear from the passage of Ecphantides)
founded on a dramatic principle; although a
species of lyric poetry, also called comedy, had existed
from an early period among the Dorians and
Æolians;<a id="noteref_1639" name="noteref_1639" href="#note_1639"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1639</span></span></a> nor can I admit the opinion of Aristotle,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page356">[pg 356]</span><a name="Pg356" id="Pg356" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that Epicharmus and Phormis were the first who
wrote a comedy with a plot or story; previously to
those poets, only some extempore and abusive speeches
(ἰαμβίζειν) were, according to his view of the subject,
introduced between the songs of the chorus; but if
this had been the case, the Megarian comedy would
not have differed materially from the Sicyonian sports
of the Phallophori, nor have attracted so much attention
as it actually did. A Megarian actor, named
Mæson, is often mentioned by the ancients as the inventor
of masks of certain characters of low comedy,
as cooks, scullions, sailors, and the like.<a id="noteref_1640" name="noteref_1640" href="#note_1640"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1640</span></span></a> Hence it
may be inferred that these Megarian farces, with their
established or frequently recurring characters, had
some resemblance to the Oscan Atellane plays.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. It is indeed very probable that the Megarian
furnished the first germ and elements of the Sicilian
comedy, as perfected by Epicharmus. For the Megarians
in Sicily, as well as those near Athens, laid
claim, according to Aristotle,<a id="noteref_1641" name="noteref_1641" href="#note_1641"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1641</span></span></a> to the invention of
comedy, and there is no doubt that a communication
was kept up between those two states. Now it is
possible that comedy was brought from Megara to
Syracuse, when Gelon (484 or 483 B.C.)<a id="noteref_1642" name="noteref_1642" href="#note_1642"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1642</span></span></a>
transplanted the inhabitants from the former to the latter
city; and thus the elements of comedy which existed
in the choruses and iambic speeches, were, by
their subsequent combination with a more improved
species of poetry, brought to maturity. This supposition,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page357">[pg 357]</span><a name="Pg357" id="Pg357" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
however, rests upon mere conjecture. Epicharmus,
the son of Helothales,<a id="noteref_1643" name="noteref_1643" href="#note_1643"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1643</span></span></a> must have gone to
Syracuse at this emigration, having formerly resided
at Megara; but he cannot be considered as the person
who really introduced comedy at Syracuse, as he
had lived only a short time at Megara; he was, as we
are credibly informed, a native of Cos,<a id="noteref_1644" name="noteref_1644" href="#note_1644"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1644</span></span></a> and went to
Sicily with Cadmus, that is, about, or soon after, 480
B.C.,<a id="noteref_1645" name="noteref_1645" href="#note_1645"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1645</span></span></a> and he must at this time have
been at least a youth, in order to have acquired a name and influence
in the reign of Hieron (between 478 and 467 B.C.)<a id="noteref_1646" name="noteref_1646" href="#note_1646"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1646</span></span></a>
In confirmation of the statement that he was a native
of Cos, it may be remarked, that he was likewise a
physician, which was the regular profession of his
brother, his family being probably connected with
that of the Asclepiadæ. Phormis, or Phormus, who
by Aristotle and others is often mentioned with Epicharmus,
appears to have been earlier than that poet
by some Olympiads, having been the friend of Gelon,
and tutor to his children;<a id="noteref_1647" name="noteref_1647" href="#note_1647"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1647</span></span></a> but his fame was so completely
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page358">[pg 358]</span><a name="Pg358" id="Pg358" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
eclipsed by that of his successor, that there is
scarcely anything remaining of his plays, except a
few titles,<a id="noteref_1648" name="noteref_1648" href="#note_1648"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1648</span></span></a> which however show that he parodied mythological
subjects.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But Epicharmus is much less known and esteemed
than his peculiar style of writing and dramatic skill
deserve; and those authors greatly err, who fix upon
the period when his peculiar kind of poetry had
arrived at perfection, as the commencement of the
Athenian comedy, and attribute the clumsy and
rustic simplicity from which the latter emerged, to
the Sicilian style, which had enjoyed all the advantages
which the life of a city and court could afford.<a id="noteref_1649" name="noteref_1649" href="#note_1649"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1649</span></span></a>
Before, therefore, we enter into details respecting
the dramas, of Epicharmus, we will say a few words
on the nature of his subjects, and his mode of handling
them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The subjects of the plays of Epicharmus were
chiefly mythological, that is, parodies or travesties of
mythology, nearly in the style of the satyric drama
of Athens. Thus in the comedy of Busiris, Hercules
was represented in the most ludicrous light, as a voracious
glutton, and he was again exhibited in the
same character (with a mixture perhaps of satirical
remarks on the luxury of the times) in <span class="tei tei-q">“the Marriage
of Hebe,”</span> in which an astonishing number of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page359">[pg 359]</span><a name="Pg359" id="Pg359" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
dishes was mentioned.<a id="noteref_1650" name="noteref_1650" href="#note_1650"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1650</span></span></a> We can however form a
better notion of the drama called <span class="tei tei-q">“Hephæstus, or
the Revellers,”</span> chiefly by the help of some ancient
works of art, which have come down to us. The
play began we are told, with Hephæstus chaining his
mother Here by magical charms to a seat, from which
he only released her after long entreaties.<a id="noteref_1651" name="noteref_1651" href="#note_1651"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1651</span></span></a> Now on
a vase discovered at Bari in the kingdom of Naples,
and now preserved in the British Museum,<a id="noteref_1652" name="noteref_1652" href="#note_1652"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1652</span></span></a> Here,

throne; on her right is a clown fantastically dressed,
whom his pointed cap marks as a servant of Hephæstus,
and his name, Dædalus, is written over his head;<a id="noteref_1654" name="noteref_1654" href="#note_1654"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1654</span></span></a>
on her left is Mars, dressed, with the exception of his
helmet, in the same fashion (with the superscription
ΕΝΕΥΑΛΙΟΣ); both these figures are armed, and
endeavouring, the one to dissolve, the other to
strengthen the charm by which Here is held. The
whole scene is evidently supposed to take place on a
stage, leading to which there are some steps; and as
there were no other Sicilian or Italian comedies on the
same subject, it may without hesitation be considered
as a representation of the first part of the Hephæstus
of Epicharmus.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The legend went on to say, that Hephæstus, having
in consequence of this act been ill-treated by his
parents, entirely deserted Olympus, until Bacchus,
having contrived to make him drunk, placed him on
an ass, and thus brought him in jolly merriment back
to Olympus; to which transaction the other title of
the piece, <span class="tei tei-q">“the Revellers,”</span> evidently alludes. Now
this scene also has been transmitted to us in some
ancient paintings, which although they do not exhibit
the theatrical dress and the place of performance so
clearly as that just mentioned, are evidently taken
from comedies. There is on a Coghill vase<a id="noteref_1655" name="noteref_1655" href="#note_1655"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1655</span></span></a> a procession

3. From these data, I will leave it to the judgment
and taste of the reader to draw his own conclusions
on the character of the drama of Epicharmus. But I
may take this opportunity of remarking, that the
painted vases of lower Italy often enable us to gain a
complete and vivid idea of the theatrical representations
of that country. From this source I have above
traced a farce, in which Hercules delivers the Cercopes
to Eurystheus, or some other king,<a id="noteref_1656" name="noteref_1656" href="#note_1656"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1656</span></span></a> and
perhaps also the picture of Hercules in the form of a
pigmy, and fighting with the cranes, was derived from
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page361">[pg 361]</span><a name="Pg361" id="Pg361" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
a similar source.<a id="noteref_1657" name="noteref_1657" href="#note_1657"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1657</span></span></a> We may likewise mention the
picture of Zeus and Hermes, the latter with a lantern,
and the former with a ladder, both dressed in the
most ridiculous and fantastical costume, in the act of
ascending to a fair female, who is expecting them at
her window.<a id="noteref_1658" name="noteref_1658" href="#note_1658"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1658</span></span></a> It seems also probable, that the buffoon
represented on a vase, as sitting on a fish, and making
ridiculous grimaces,<a id="noteref_1659" name="noteref_1659" href="#note_1659"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1659</span></span></a> is a caricature of the Tarentine
fable of Taras on the dolphin. The costume, which
reminds us of the Italian Policinello and Arlecchino,<a id="noteref_1660" name="noteref_1660" href="#note_1660"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1660</span></span></a>
proves that it was taken from a dramatic representation,
which however is still more conspicuous on the
painted vase of Asteas,<a id="noteref_1661" name="noteref_1661" href="#note_1661"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1661</span></span></a> on which, among a number of
clowns, one is seen stretched on a couch, evidently the
bed of Procrustes. But it is remarkable, that in this
case the performers do not bear the names of the
heroes whom they travesty, but those of their masks.
The one on the bed is called ΧΑΡΙΝΟΣ, or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Gracioso</span></span>
(which name was likewise in use at Sparta);<a id="noteref_1662" name="noteref_1662" href="#note_1662"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1662</span></span></a> the

letters are read correctly: these are evidently names
of standing characters of a dramatic fable, resembling
the Attelane farces of Campania. The vase was
moreover discovered in Campania.<a id="noteref_1664" name="noteref_1664" href="#note_1664"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1664</span></span></a>

4. But to return to Epicharmus; the comedy of
this poet was by no means confined to parodies of
mythological stories, as he also, like Aristophanes,
handled political subjects, and invented comic characters
like the later Athenian poets; and indeed the extent
of his subjects was very wide. The piece called
Ἁρπαγαὶ, or <span class="tei tei-q">“the Plunderings,”</span> which described
the devastation of Sicily in his time, had, according to
Hemsterhuis,<a id="noteref_1665" name="noteref_1665" href="#note_1665"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1665</span></span></a> a political meaning; and this
was perhaps also the case with the Νᾶσοι, or <span class="tei tei-q">“the
Islands:”</span> at least it was mentioned in this play, that
Hieron had prevented Anaxilas from destroying
Locri (477 B.C.);<a id="noteref_1666" name="noteref_1666" href="#note_1666"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1666</span></span></a> in his <span class="tei tei-q">“Persians”</span> also there
were allusions to the history of the times. The play
called the <span class="tei tei-q">“Countryman”</span> (Ἀγρωστῖνος, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> ἀγροῖκος),
was an instance of the drama, which illustrated the
character of a certain class of society. Epicharmus
also introduced, and almost perfected characters, which
were very common in the drama of later times;<a id="noteref_1667" name="noteref_1667" href="#note_1667"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1667</span></span></a> and if
the plot of the Menæchmi of Plautus was, as the poet
seems to state in the prologue, taken from a comedy
of Epicharmus, it must be granted that the ingenious
construction of plots was not beyond the powers of
that poet.<a id="noteref_1668" name="noteref_1668" href="#note_1668"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1668</span></span></a> The style of his plays was not less various
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page363">[pg 363]</span><a name="Pg363" id="Pg363" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
than his subjects, as he passed from the extreme
of rude and comic buffoonery to a more serious and
instructive vein, introducing maxims and moral sentences<a id="noteref_1669" name="noteref_1669" href="#note_1669"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1669</span></span></a>
with precepts of the Pythagorean philosophy,
in which he is said to have been initiated with Archytas
and Philolaus the son of Arcesas, the successor of
Pythagoras;<a id="noteref_1670" name="noteref_1670" href="#note_1670"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1670</span></span></a> and we know from Diogenes Laertius
that he introduced long discourses of a speculative
and philosophical nature, though it is not easy to see
how they were connected with the rest of the piece.
In the Ulysses (as I conjecture from the speech to
Eumæus) he made incidentally some philosophical
remarks on the instinct of animals;<a id="noteref_1671" name="noteref_1671" href="#note_1671"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1671</span></span></a> other
pieces, such as <span class="tei tei-q">“the Pyrrha and Prometheus,”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“the
Land and Sea,”</span> were by their subjects still more
closely connected with philosophy; he also wrote
some poems on questions of natural and moral philosophy,
which, if we may judge from the imitation of
Ennius, were composed in a theatrical and very lively
metre, the trochaic tetrameter.<a id="noteref_1672" name="noteref_1672" href="#note_1672"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1672</span></span></a> That the dramatic
style of Epicharmus was perfect in its kind, is proved
by the great admiration it was held in by the ancients,
particularly by Plato; and if the Attic comedy excelled
in cutting satire and ridicule, the Sicilian poet
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page364">[pg 364]</span><a name="Pg364" id="Pg364" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
had a higher and more general aim. The Athenian
poets, if we may judge from Aristophanes, confined
themselves wholly to the affairs of their own state,
and it was their object to point out what they considered
beneficial to the people. But Epicharmus had
a different and higher object; for if the elements of
his drama, which we have discovered singly, were in
his plays combined, he must have set out with an
elevated and philosophical view, which enabled him to
satirize mankind, without disturbing the calmness and
tranquillity of his thoughts; while at the same time
his scenes of common life were marked with the acute
and penetrating genius which characterized the
Sicilians.<a id="noteref_1673" name="noteref_1673" href="#note_1673"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1673</span></span></a>

5. Notwithstanding this excellence, the comedy of
Epicharmus was only an insulated and passing phenomenon,
as we are not informed of any successors
of that great poet, except Deinolochus<a id="noteref_1674" name="noteref_1674" href="#note_1674"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1674</span></span></a>
his son, or rather his disciple. But about half a century after
Epicharmus,<a id="noteref_1675" name="noteref_1675" href="#note_1675"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1675</span></span></a> Sophron, the mimographer, made his
appearance, who was the author of a new species of
comedy, though in many respects resembling that of
his predecessor. Still this variety of the drama differed
so much, not only from that of Sicily, but from
any other which existed in Greece, that its origin
must, after all our attempts at explanation, remain
involved in great obscurity. The mimes of Sophron
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page365">[pg 365]</span><a name="Pg365" id="Pg365" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
had no accompaniment of music or dancing, and they
were written, not in verse, but in prose, though perhaps
in certain <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">rhythmical divisions</span></em>.<a id="noteref_1676" name="noteref_1676" href="#note_1676"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1676</span></span></a> This latter
circumstance seems quite singular, and without example
in the Greek literature which has been transmitted
to us. But that it was in reality so, seems
improbable, when we remember that there would
naturally be an intermediate rhythm, formed at the
transition from the metrical to the prosaic style;<a id="noteref_1677" name="noteref_1677" href="#note_1677"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1677</span></span></a> and
with the Dorians this would have taken the form of
concise and disjointed sentences, a periodical style
being more suited to the Athenians. We are led to
this notion by the consideration of some remains of
Lacedæmonian composition, in which no one can fail
to see the rhythmical form and symmetry of the sentences.
Thus in the famous letter of Hippocrates,<a id="noteref_1678" name="noteref_1678" href="#note_1678"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1678</span></span></a>

Whether the mimes of Sophron were publicly represented
or not, is a question not easily answered.
It would however be singular, if a poetical work had
been intended only for reading, in an age when everything
was written, not for the public eye, but for the
public ear. It is certainly more probable that these
mimes were originally part of the amusements of
certain festivals, as was the case with the Spartan
deicelictæ, which they resembled more than any other
variety of the drama.<a id="noteref_1681" name="noteref_1681" href="#note_1681"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1681</span></span></a> Indeed it can be easily conceived,
that farces of this description, acted by persons
who had a quick perception of the eccentricities
and peculiarities of mankind, and a talent for mimicry,
should have existed among the Dorians of Sicily, as
well as of Laconia, particularly as the former were
celebrated for their imitative skill.<a id="noteref_1682" name="noteref_1682" href="#note_1682"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1682</span></span></a> Even Agathocles

people, by ridiculing certain known characters, in the
manner of an <span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">ethologus</span></span>, or merry

the mimes of Sophron, by which these rude
attempts were improved, and raised to a regular
species of the drama, were distinguished by their faithful
imitation of manners, even of the vulgar, and the
solecisms and rude dialect of the common people
were copied with great exactness;<a id="noteref_1684" name="noteref_1684" href="#note_1684"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1684</span></span></a> whence the numerous
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page367">[pg 367]</span><a name="Pg367" id="Pg367" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
sayings and proverbs which were introduced.<a id="noteref_1685" name="noteref_1685" href="#note_1685"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1685</span></span></a>
On the other hand, he was most skilful in seizing the
more delicate shades and turns of feeling, and in preserving
the unity and consistency of his characters,
without which he would never have been so much admired
by Plato, or the study of his works have been
so serviceable in the composition of the Socratic
dialogues, as we know on good authority to have been
the case;<a id="noteref_1686" name="noteref_1686" href="#note_1686"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1686</span></span></a> and hence we should compare the scenery
of Plato's dialogues with the poems of Theocritus,
which we know to be imitated from the female mimes
of Sophron, in order to obtain a proper idea of those
master-pieces. His talent for description must however
have been supported and directed by moral considerations;
which probably preponderated rather in
the serious (μῖμοι σπουδαῖοι), and were less prominent
in the common mimes (μῖμοι γέλοιοι). The tribe of
Aretalogi and Ethologi, who originally spoke much
of virtue and morality, but gradually sank into mere
buffoons, appears to have come from Sicily, and was,
perhaps through several intermediate links, connected
with Sophron.<a id="noteref_1687" name="noteref_1687" href="#note_1687"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1687</span></span></a>

In considering these philosophical sports, which
mingled in the same breath the grave and solemn
lessons of philosophy and the most ludicrous mimicry
and buffoonery, we may perhaps find a reason why
Persius, a youth educated in the Stoic sect, should
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page368">[pg 368]</span><a name="Pg368" id="Pg368" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
have thought of making Sophron the model of his
Satires. This statement is given by a late, but in
this instance a credible writer,<a id="noteref_1688" name="noteref_1688" href="#note_1688"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1688</span></span></a> and is confirmed by
the dramatic character of the Satires of Persius, and
the constant use of mimicry in them, particularly the
first four; so much so indeed, that a study of Persius
is the best method of forming an accurate and lively
idea of the mimes of Sophron.

6. The Dorians in general had evidently less
poetical skill and feeling than the Athenians, and did
not cultivate those rude attempts of wit and mirth
which the festivals called forth, and of which the
Athenians knew so well how to take advantage.
This incapacity or negligence of the early times
enables us to explain why several kinds of Doric
poetry were not received into the literature of civilized
Greece until the Alexandrian age, of which we may
particularly specify the bucolic poetry, and the phlyaces
of Tarentum. These carnival sports had doubtless
been represented for ages, before they acquired,
in the time of Ptolemy the First, notoriety in other
places by the poems of Rhinthon, which were named
after them. These plays are also called Ἱλαροτραγῳδία,<a id="noteref_1689" name="noteref_1689" href="#note_1689"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1689</span></span></a>
or tragi-comedy; and both these and the titles
of some pieces<a id="noteref_1690" name="noteref_1690" href="#note_1690"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1690</span></span></a> and fragments handed down to us
show that they were burlesques of tragical subjects.<a id="noteref_1691" name="noteref_1691" href="#note_1691"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1691</span></span></a>
It may, however, be easily supposed that Rhinthon
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page369">[pg 369]</span><a name="Pg369" id="Pg369" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
did not lose sight of the Athenian tragedy, and it is
possible that his two Iphigenias in particular, at Aulis
and Tauris, contained many parodies of the two plays
of Euripides. I should conceive, however, that he
adhered generally to the form of the ancient phlyaces;
thus for example, he faithfully imitated the dialect of
Tarentum;<a id="noteref_1692" name="noteref_1692" href="#note_1692"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1692</span></span></a> we may also be assured that he polished
the native farces, so as to fit them for theatrical
representation. These pieces were generally written
in trimeter iambics, which Rhinthon, however,
framed somewhat carelessly, as may be seen from
a fragment of his transmitted to us, where addressing
himself to his verses, he declares <span class="tei tei-q">“that he did
not give himself much trouble about them;”</span><a id="noteref_1693" name="noteref_1693" href="#note_1693"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1693</span></span></a> it is
also possible that he mixed the iambic with other
metres, as parodies, for the sake of contrast; thus,
for instance, he appears to have employed the solemn
hexameter in some very ludicrous passages.<a id="noteref_1694" name="noteref_1694" href="#note_1694"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1694</span></span></a> Rhinthon
was succeeded in this species of parody by

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page370">[pg 370]</span><a name="Pg370" id="Pg370" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
a native of Capreæ in Campania, wrote (as may be
inferred from the title of his <span class="tei tei-q">“Saturn”</span>) after the Roman
manners and religion had gained the ascendency;
but he used only the ancient dialect, and he too, being
called a serio-comic poet (σπουδογελοίων ποιητὴς),
seems to have adopted the same mixture of tragedy
and comedy.<a id="noteref_1696" name="noteref_1696" href="#note_1696"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1696</span></span></a>

7. We have now dwelt at some length on the comic
poetry of the Dorians, on account of the interesting
nature of the subject, and the light which it throws
on the general character of a people, among whom the
strictest gravity was found closely united with the
most unrestrained jocularity and mirth; for as every
real jest requires for a foundation a firm, solid, and
grave disposition of mind, so moral indifference, and a
frivolous temperament, not only destroy the contrast
between gravity and jest, but annihilate the spirit of
both. Our inquiries on the early state of the tragic
drama among the Dorians will be more concise. And
we may first observe, that the great difference between
tragedy and comedy did not exist originally but was
only formed gradually in their development. Their
only distinction at first was, that while comedy was
more a sport and a merriment of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">country</span></em> festivals,
tragedy was from its commencement connected with
the public rejoicings and ceremonies of Bacchus in
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cities</span></em>, and was performed by the great cyclic or
dithyrambic choruses. Thence it came that the former
expressed the boisterous mirth and joviality of clowns
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page371">[pg 371]</span><a name="Pg371" id="Pg371" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and peasants; whereas the latter was formed upon
the particular ideas and feelings suggested by the worship
of Bacchus, and by the part which he bore in
mythology. It principally turned on the sufferings of
Bacchus (Διονύσου πάθη), a point alluded to in some
verses in the Iliad, though there is no doubt that it had
been attempted at a much earlier period.<a id="noteref_1697" name="noteref_1697" href="#note_1697"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1697</span></span></a>

8. We shall now show how this applies to the tragedy
of the Dorians. According to the account of
Herodotus<a id="noteref_1698" name="noteref_1698" href="#note_1698"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1698</span></span></a> there were at Sicyon, an ancient seat of
the worship of Bacchus, tragic choruses which sung
of Bacchus, and undoubtedly of his sufferings. These
choruses however had even before the age of Cleisthenes
(Olymp. 45.) been transferred to Adrastus,
the hero of that city, but they were by that tyrant
restored to their former subject. The date of their
restoration is therefore known; the time of their extension
to Adrastus, and consequently of their foundation,
must have been much more remote; this shows
the comparatively late date of the Attic tragedy, which
began with Thespis. Now we are also informed that
Epigenes, a very ancient tragedian of Sicyon, was the
sixteenth before Thespis;<a id="noteref_1699" name="noteref_1699" href="#note_1699"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1699</span></span></a> thus it appears that the
ancients were in possession of a stock of information,
which has been lost to us, that enabled them to draw
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page372">[pg 372]</span><a name="Pg372" id="Pg372" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
up a regular succession of all the intermediate tragic
poets. To this if we add that some of the Peloponnesians,
as we are told by Aristotle,<a id="noteref_1700" name="noteref_1700" href="#note_1700"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1700</span></span></a> disputed with
the Athenians the invention of tragedy,<a id="noteref_1701" name="noteref_1701" href="#note_1701"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1701</span></span></a> we shall not
be inclined to deny the claims of the former, on the
mere ground that their song, being drowned by the
louder notes of the Athenians, was thus early silenced.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But it remains to be decided, whether this Sicyonian
tragedy belonged to the regular drama, or whether
it was merely a species of dithyrambic lyric
poetry, the existence of which was first proved some
few years ago by a learned writer of this country.<a id="noteref_1702" name="noteref_1702" href="#note_1702"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1702</span></span></a>
Of these hypotheses the latter seems most probable,
as the accounts of the Athenians respecting the origin
and progress of their own tragedy can only then be
justified, and because it is distinctly stated that the
early tragedy consisted exclusively of choruses.<a id="noteref_1703" name="noteref_1703" href="#note_1703"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1703</span></span></a> But
I should conceive that these Bacchanalian songs were
always accompanied by some mimicry; which indeed
the nature of that worship would seem to require;
the liveliness of the feelings which it inspired calling
for a personified representation of them; and thus
Arion, who is styled the inventor of the tragic style
(τραγικὸς πρόπος), is said to have introduced satyrs
into his choruses.<a id="noteref_1704" name="noteref_1704" href="#note_1704"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1704</span></span></a> Arion, although by birth a
Methymnæan, and probably a disciple of Terpander,
chiefly lived and wrote (like his predecessors, mentioned
above) in Peloponnesus and among Dorian
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page373">[pg 373]</span><a name="Pg373" id="Pg373" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
nations. It was at Corinth, in the reign of Periander,<a id="noteref_1705" name="noteref_1705" href="#note_1705"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1705</span></span></a>
that he first practised a cyclic chorus<a id="noteref_1706" name="noteref_1706" href="#note_1706"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1706</span></span></a> in the performance
of a dithyramb,<a id="noteref_1707" name="noteref_1707" href="#note_1707"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1707</span></span></a> where he probably took advantage
of some local accidents and rude beginnings,
which alone could justify Pindar in considering Corinth
as the native city of the dithyramb.<a id="noteref_1708" name="noteref_1708" href="#note_1708"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1708</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus the district of Corinth and Sicyon is of considerable
importance in the early history of the drama.
Phlius also, where the satirical drama probably first
became a separate variety of the ancient tragedy, was
situate in that part: whence being introduced into
Athens, it was brought into a regular dramatical
shape. For Pratinas the Phliasian is truly called the
inventor of this species of the drama;<a id="noteref_1709" name="noteref_1709" href="#note_1709"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1709</span></span></a> and although
he contended for the prize with Æschylus at Athens,
he nevertheless must have remained a native of Phlius,
as his son and successor Aristeas was a citizen of that
city, and was buried there.<a id="noteref_1710" name="noteref_1710" href="#note_1710"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1710</span></span></a> I have nothing to

9. Having now examined the two species of the
drama, comedy and tragedy, under different heads, we
will next consider them under the general name of
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">orchestic</span></em> poetry, or poetry accompanied with dancing.
For while all poetry which was necessarily attended
with music was called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">lyric</span></em>, that which was sung to
accompany dances, frequently of large choruses, has
been called the Doric lyric poetry;<a id="noteref_1712" name="noteref_1712" href="#note_1712"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1712</span></span></a> to which appellation
it appears to be justly entitled, as in its various
forms it always partakes more or less of the Doric
dialect. Hence the terms Doric and Choral poetry
may be used as synonymous, as songs for choral dances
were usually composed in the Doric dialect; and
whenever the Doric dialect occurred in regular lyric
odes, these were generally for choral dances.<a id="noteref_1713" name="noteref_1713" href="#note_1713"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1713</span></span></a> Thus,
for instance, Pindar, the master of the Dorian lyric
poetry, composed scolia; which, unlike the poems
sung at feasts, were accompanied with dances and
contained more of the Doric dialect.<a id="noteref_1714" name="noteref_1714" href="#note_1714"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1714</span></span></a> Thus the dithyramb,
so long as it belonged to the Dorian lyric
poetry, was always antistrophic, that is, in a choral
form, or one adapted to dancing; but after being
new-modelled by Crexus, Phrynis, and others, it ceased
to be acted by cyclic choruses, and its dialect at the
same time underwent a total change. Choruses were
sung in the Doric dialect in the midst of the Attic
drama; so peculiarly did the choral dances seem to
belong to the Dorians.<a id="noteref_1715" name="noteref_1715" href="#note_1715"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1715</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These facts afford two criterions for ascertaining
the character of the lyric poetry of the Dorians. In
the first place, it always bore the stamp of publicity;
as in the formation of choruses the public was in
some manner taken into consideration: secondly, it
had some religious reference; as choruses ever formed
part of religious worship. The feeling therefore
expressed by this kind of lyric poetry, though it
might more powerfully affect individuals, should nevertheless
be of such a nature as to interest a whole
people; and the subject, even if suggested by other
circumstances, should have a reference to religious
notions, and admit of a mythological treatment.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
10. Thus much concerning the character of lyric
poetry among the Dorians. But if we proceed to
inquire what gave to this species of poetry the characteristic
mark of the people, the circumstances
which first strike the attention will rather surprise than
enlighten us. For, in the first place, it is plain that
no Greek city was wholly without choral poetry; and
that prosodia, pæans, and dithyrambs, as soon as they
obtained a separate existence, spread in a short time
over the whole of Greece. Secondly, among the chief
founders and masters of the Dorian lyric poetry, the
smaller number only were Dorians, the others being
either of Æolian or Ionian descent. Thus Terpander,
the ancient pæan-singer, Arion, the inventor of the
dithyramb, and Pindar, were Æolians; Ibycus of
Rhegium, Bacchylides, and Simonides of Ceos, were
Ionians; and of the more celebrated poets the only
Dorians were Stesichorus of Himera, and Alcman,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page376">[pg 376]</span><a name="Pg376" id="Pg376" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
by birth a Laconian, though descended from a Lydian
family. This last fact however may be reconciled
with the view taken above, by the supposition that a
certain <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">national style</span></em> had from an early period been
established in the native country of this choral poetry,
to which the poets of the several cities generally conformed;
while in other places, being more thrown on
their own resources, they were led to cultivate their
talent with greater freedom. Thus the choral poetry
flourished in no part of Greece so much as at Sparta,<a id="noteref_1716" name="noteref_1716" href="#note_1716"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1716</span></span></a>
as is proved by the best authorities, viz. Terpander<a id="noteref_1717" name="noteref_1717" href="#note_1717"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1717</span></span></a> and Pindar.<a id="noteref_1718" name="noteref_1718" href="#note_1718"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1718</span></span></a> But besides the foreign, though
almost naturalized poets, such as Terpander, Thaletas,
Nymphæeus of Cydonia,<a id="noteref_1719" name="noteref_1719" href="#note_1719"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1719</span></span></a>
and Simonides,<a id="noteref_1720" name="noteref_1720" href="#note_1720"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1720</span></span></a> there were
also more native lyric poets at Sparta than in any
other place;<a id="noteref_1721" name="noteref_1721" href="#note_1721"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1721</span></span></a> of whom we know by name, Spendon,<a id="noteref_1722" name="noteref_1722" href="#note_1722"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1722</span></span></a> Dionysodotus,<a id="noteref_1723" name="noteref_1723" href="#note_1723"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1723</span></span></a> Xenodamus,<a id="noteref_1724" name="noteref_1724" href="#note_1724"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1724</span></span></a> and Gitiadas, who sung

not been preserved a single fragment of Spartan lyric
poetry, with the exception of Alcman's; because, as
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page377">[pg 377]</span><a name="Pg377" id="Pg377" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
we showed above, there was a certain uniformity and
monotony in their productions, such as is perceivable
in the early works of art, which prevented any single
part from being prominent or distinguished. Something
must also be attributed to the effects of a censorship,
either of manners or of literary works; as
the Spartans are said to have banished Archilochus
from their city either on account of his cowardice, or
of the licentiousness of his poems;<a id="noteref_1726" name="noteref_1726" href="#note_1726"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1726</span></span></a> while, on the other

of the use of the lyre at Sparta is proved by
the fondness of the female sex for it.<a id="noteref_1728" name="noteref_1728" href="#note_1728"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1728</span></span></a> And besides

lyric poets known only to their own age and country,
we may form some notion from the circumstance that
Pindar, celebrating a native of Ægina, incidentally
mentions two minstrels of the same family, Timocritus
and Euphanes the Theandridæ.<a id="noteref_1733" name="noteref_1733" href="#note_1733"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1733</span></span></a> Besides those already

us: Lasus of Hermione, a poet and musician, who
had improved the dithyramb after Arion, and the
Æolian style of music before Pindar; Ariphron of
Sicyon, a composer of pæans; Cleobulus of Rhodes,
who was both a philosopher and a lyric poet; and
the peculiar genius of Timocreon, who tuned the
Doric lyre against Simonides and Themistocles, having
been roused against the latter by the unjust conduct
of Athens towards the islands.<a id="noteref_1734" name="noteref_1734" href="#note_1734"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1734</span></span></a> Later poets we shall

11. The above statements merely go to establish
the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fact</span></em>, that the choral lyric poetry, chiefly and originally
belonged to the Dorians. In what manner
this fact is to be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">accounted for</span></em>, what were the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">causes</span></em>
of this phenomenon, can only be explained in a general
history of the lyric poetry of the Greeks, a subject at
once the most attractive and most difficult which
remains for the industry of the present age. In the
absence of such an investigation, I may be permitted
to offer on that question a few remarks, which the
occasion prevents me from supporting with a detailed
body of evidence.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the first place then it will, I believe, be safe to
give up the notion that the lyric was regularly and
gradually developed from epic poetry. The epic
poetry, beginning at a period when the Achæans were
yet in possession of Peloponnesus,<a id="noteref_1735" name="noteref_1735" href="#note_1735"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1735</span></span></a> retaining till the
latest times a peculiar dialect, and continued under
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page379">[pg 379]</span><a name="Pg379" id="Pg379" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
its ancient form by Greeks of all races,<a id="noteref_1736" name="noteref_1736" href="#note_1736"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1736</span></span></a> does not
show any tendency to produce an offspring so unlike
itself; and what could be more different than the recitation
of a single bard and the religious songs of a
chorus? From the time that there were Greeks and
a Greek language there were doubtless songs at processions,
both at festivals and to the temples, as well
as during the sacrifice; and these varying according
to the mode of worship and attributes of the god.
And in none were they so early reduced to rule as in
the worship of Apollo; to which, as has been already
shown,<a id="noteref_1737" name="noteref_1737" href="#note_1737"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1737</span></span></a> the ancient nomes, the pæans,
and hyporchemes, and other varieties of lyric poetry, either
in part or wholly, owed their origin. Now since this
worship was originally Doric, and its chief temples
were always in Doric countries, we can see a reason
why in the ceremonial, that is the choral, poetry, the
Doric dialect should have preponderated. Its form
was, on the whole, originally a Doric variety of the
epic hexameter; which was the rhythm of the ancient
nomes composed by the minstrels Philammon, Olen,
and Chrysothemis.<a id="noteref_1738" name="noteref_1738" href="#note_1738"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1738</span></span></a> Their ancient strains, which
were sung and danced to, must have been very different
from the delivery of the Homeric rhapsodists, a sort
of chaunting recitation; for Terpander is said to have
first set them, as well as the laws of Lycurgus,<a id="noteref_1739" name="noteref_1739" href="#note_1739"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1739</span></span></a> to a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page380">[pg 380]</span><a name="Pg380" id="Pg380" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
regular tune; whereas these ancient religious hymns
had such tunes from the beginning; while the mode
to which they were set can hardly have been any other
than the Doric. The attempt to vary the rhythm probably
began by breaking the dactylic hexameters into
shorter portions, in order to produce new combinations
of less uniform verses, and thus gave rise to the antistrophic
form of metre.<a id="noteref_1740" name="noteref_1740" href="#note_1740"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1740</span></span></a> A different origin must, however,
as is natural, be assigned to the anapæstic
military songs; nor can we suppose that pæans and
hyporchemes ever followed the laws of hexameters;
the pæonian variety must have been earlier than
Alcman, who made use of Cretic hexameters. Generally
indeed Alcman, however early his age, made use
of a great variety of metres; the reason of which probably
is, that before his time Terpander had mixed
the Greek and Asiatic music; besides which, Alcman
had doubtless, from his Lydian origin, an inclination
to the eastern style of music; for in this a large
portion of his songs, in which the logaœdic metre
prevailed, were evidently composed:<a id="noteref_1741" name="noteref_1741" href="#note_1741"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1741</span></span></a> he was also
acquainted with Phrygian melodies.<a id="noteref_1742" name="noteref_1742" href="#note_1742"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1742</span></span></a> But the diversity
of his metres was only to express the variety
of his muse, which sometimes adored the gods in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page381">[pg 381]</span><a name="Pg381" id="Pg381" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
solemn choruses (in which, when he danced himself,
he implored the sweetly-singing virgins to be the
supports of his age<a id="noteref_1743" name="noteref_1743" href="#note_1743"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1743</span></span></a>), now wrote bridal-hymns and
drinking-songs; a sufficient refutation of the notion
that life at Sparta was one unvaried scene of gloominess
and melancholy; in which town these songs
continued nevertheless to be popular until the time of
Epaminondas.<a id="noteref_1744" name="noteref_1744" href="#note_1744"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1744</span></span></a>

12. If the essence of art consists in investing an
idea of the mind with a sensible and bodily form, and
this in a corresponding and satisfactory manner, we
must certainly ascribe great skill in art to the Dorians,
for (as we have before remarked) they delighted
more in imitation than in creation or action. This
remark applies to the Greeks in general, and particularly
to the Dorians, as distinguished from later
times; hence the attention of that race to the beauty
of form; <span class="tei tei-q">“Give us what is good and what is beautiful”</span>
was the Spartan prayer.<a id="noteref_1745" name="noteref_1745" href="#note_1745"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1745</span></span></a> Whoever had enjoyed

We may here be permitted to annex a few remarks
on the art of sculpture; and we will curtail them the
more, as it does not bear so much upon national manners
as music, which formed a part of the education of
the people, while the former art was consigned to the
care of a few. Although from what we have observed
elsewhere, it would be difficult to describe all in the
ancient sculpture that was peculiar to the Doric nation,
and that originated from them, we may still draw
some conclusions from what has been already stated.
There was in the Doric character a certain healthy
sensibility, and a delight in the unadorned and unveiled
forms of nature. That this very much favoured
and assisted the progress of the above art is obvious;
and that the human form was accurately studied and
understood in the Doric schools of art is shown in
those specimens of their works which have been preserved.
The physical beauty of this race, ennobled
and exposed to view by gymnastic<a id="noteref_1747" name="noteref_1747" href="#note_1747"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1747</span></span></a> and warlike exercises,
gave a right direction to the study of sculpture;
and the prevailing religion, the worship of Apollo, by
the energy of the figure and variety of the attributes
of that god, shows not only the original talent of this
people for sculpture, but it was fitted to lead them by
a succession of compositions to the highest excellence.
On the other hand, we may infer from some of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page383">[pg 383]</span><a name="Pg383" id="Pg383" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
above remarks, that the Dorians considered the beauty
of art to consist more in proportion, harmony, and
regularity, than in a superabundance of glitter and
ornament; and this is exemplified by the character of
Doric architecture. Lastly, hence arises the composure
and evenness of mind which so greatly distinguished
the Dorians, who anxiously preserved the
usages of their fathers as much in the art of sculpture
as in music.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Although historical tradition does not extend so far
as to prove and verify this view of the subject, still it
agrees with all that is characteristic of the Dorians.
In the first place then, we know that sculpture was
diligently cultivated at an early time in several Doric
cities; first perhaps in Crete, the most ancient abode
of Doric civilisation;<a id="noteref_1748" name="noteref_1748" href="#note_1748"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1748</span></span></a> then in Ægina,<a id="noteref_1749" name="noteref_1749" href="#note_1749"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1749</span></span></a> Sicyon,
Corinth, Argos,<a id="noteref_1750" name="noteref_1750" href="#note_1750"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1750</span></span></a> and Sparta; for that the latter city,
particularly at the time of the Persian war, was distinguished
by its active pursuit of the arts, has been
sufficiently proved in a former part of this
work.<a id="noteref_1751" name="noteref_1751" href="#note_1751"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1751</span></span></a>
Sicyon produced the Apollo of Canachus, of which we
have elsewhere endeavoured to give an idea;<a id="noteref_1752" name="noteref_1752" href="#note_1752"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1752</span></span></a>
and about the same time the Æginetan artists appear to
have produced those groups of heroes, the fragments
of which are the only sure records which we possess
of the peculiarities of that school. For the information
which we receive from Pausanias and others
goes no further than that in Ægina many statues of the
most ancient kind were sculptured, and that a certain
hardness of style was preserved there longer than in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page384">[pg 384]</span><a name="Pg384" id="Pg384" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Attica. The fragments, however, which remain, attest
a liveliness of conception, and a truth of imitation,
which in many points may be called perfect, and
which excite our admiration, and even astonishment.
On the other hand, we may remark in the countenances
of the heroes, who evidently bear a Greek
national physiognomy, though rudely and unpleasingly
conceived, that respect for ancient customs which was
a fundamental principle of the early times. That
this happened at a time when Athens had already cast
off every shackle, is a strong characteristic trait of the
Dorians. These works, however, possess many other
singularities, which cannot be referred to any peculiar
disposition of that race.

1. It has been shown in the preceding chapter that
the national and original poetry of the Doric race was
not the epic, but the lyric; which is occupied rather
in expressing inward feelings, than in describing outward
objects. If this predilection may be considered
as natural to the whole race, it will enable us to explain
why history neither originated among, nor was
cultivated by the Dorians. For both its progress and
invention we are indebted to the Ionians, who were
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page385">[pg 385]</span><a name="Pg385" id="Pg385" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
also the first to introduce prose-composition in general.<a id="noteref_1753" name="noteref_1753" href="#note_1753"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1753</span></span></a>
The Dorians, however, did not always retain this incapacity;
for we are told that the Spartans gladly
listened to the sophist Hippias of Elis, speaking of
the families of heroes and men, the settlements by
which the cities had in ancient times been founded,
and of ancient events in general.<a id="noteref_1754" name="noteref_1754" href="#note_1754"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1754</span></span></a> This naturally
suggests the remark, that the Dorians paid more
attention to the events of the past than of the present
time; in which they are greatly opposed to the Ionians,
who from their governments and geographical position
were more thrown into society, and interested themselves
more in the passing affairs of the day. Hence
some of the early writers on mythical history were
Dorians, as Acusilaus for example; but the contemporary
historians were almost exclusively Ionians and
Athenians;<a id="noteref_1755" name="noteref_1755" href="#note_1755"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1755</span></span></a> for Herodotus, who in his early years
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page386">[pg 386]</span><a name="Pg386" id="Pg386" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
had lived for some time at Samos, and after his various
travels wrote his History at Thurii, can hardly be considered
as a genuine Dorian.<a id="noteref_1756" name="noteref_1756" href="#note_1756"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1756</span></span></a> Nor would it be difficult
to account for the entire ignorance of the arts of rhetoric
and logic in the Doric states (for the schools of
rhetoricians and sophists in Sicily are evidently to be
traced to the peculiar character of those islanders),<a id="noteref_1757" name="noteref_1757" href="#note_1757"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1757</span></span></a> or
to see why the perfection of these, both in theory and
practice, as well as that of the regular drama, was left
to the Athenians.

2. But instead of the pointed and logical reasoning,
and the fervid declamation of the Athenians, the Doric
race had a peculiar manner of expressing itself, viz.
by apophthegms, and sententious and concise sayings.

The object appears to have been, to convey as much
meaning in as few words as possible, and to allude to,
rather than express, the thoughts of the speaker. A
habit of mind which might fit its possessor for such
a mode of speaking, would best be generated by long
and unbroken <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">silence</span></em>; which was enjoined to his

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page388">[pg 388]</span><a name="Pg388" id="Pg388" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the Dorians may be conceived, in the first place, to
have wished to avoid all ornament of speech, and to
have contented themselves with the simplest manner
of conveying their thoughts; as Stesimbrotus the
Thasian opposes to the adroit and eloquent Athenian
the openness and simplicity of the Peloponnesian, who
was plain and unadorned, but of an honest and guileless
disposition.<a id="noteref_1766" name="noteref_1766" href="#note_1766"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1766</span></span></a> Or, secondly, it was
intended to have double force by the contrast of the richness of
the thought, with the slight expense of words. Probably,
however, both these motives had their weight;
though the latter perhaps predominated. In a dialogue
of Plato,<a id="noteref_1767" name="noteref_1767" href="#note_1767"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1767</span></span></a> Socrates says, half in joke and half
in earnest, that <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">of all the philosophical systems in
Greece, that established in Crete and Lacedæmon
was the most ancient and copious, and there the
sophists were most numerous; but they concealed
their skill, and pretended to be ignorant. And
hence, on conversing with the meanest Lacedæmonian,
at first indeed he would appear awkward
in his language, but when he perceived the drift
of the conversation, he would throw in, like a
dexterous lancer, some short and nervous remark,
so as to make the other look no better than a child.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
That in this concise manner of speaking there was
a kind of wit and epigrammatic point, may be easily
seen from various examples; but it cannot be traced
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page389">[pg 389]</span><a name="Pg389" id="Pg389" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to the principles which we have just laid down.
Sometimes it arises from the simplicity of the Doric
manners, as contrasted with the more polished customs
of other nations; of which kind is the answer of the
Spartan, who, taking a fish to be cooked, and being
asked where the cheese, oil, and vinegar were, replied,
<span class="tei tei-q">“If I had all these things, I should not have bought
a fish.”</span><a id="noteref_1768" name="noteref_1768" href="#note_1768"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1768</span></span></a> Or it is a moral elevation, viewed from
which, things appear in a different light; thus the
saying of Dieneces, that <span class="tei tei-q">“if the Persians darkened
the air with their arrows, they should fight in
the shade.”</span> Sometimes it is an ironical expression
of bitterness and censure, which gains force by being
concealed under a semblance of praise; as in the judgment
of the Laconian on Athens, where every kind
of trade and industry was tolerated, <span class="tei tei-q">“Everything is
beautiful there.”</span><a id="noteref_1769" name="noteref_1769" href="#note_1769"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1769</span></span></a> Or it is the combination of
various ridiculous ideas into one expression, as in the
witty saying of a husband who found his wife, whom
he detested, in the arms of an adulterer; <span class="tei tei-q">“Unhappy
man, who forced you to do this?”</span><a id="noteref_1770" name="noteref_1770" href="#note_1770"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1770</span></span></a>

At Sparta, however, an energetic, striking, and
figurative mode of speaking must have been generally
in use; which may be perceived in the style of all the
Spartans who are mentioned by Herodotus.<a id="noteref_1771" name="noteref_1771" href="#note_1771"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1771</span></span></a> And

this, I have no doubt, was one of the most ancient
customs of the Doric race. In Crete it had been
retained, according to the testimony of Sosicrates, a
Cretan author, in the town of Phæstus, in which place
the boys were early practised in joking; and the
apophthegms of Phæstus were celebrated over the
whole island.<a id="noteref_1772" name="noteref_1772" href="#note_1772"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1772</span></span></a> In Sparta too this peculiar
mode of expression was implanted in boys; the youths (ἔφηβοι)
proposing them questions, to which they were to give
ready and pointed answers;<a id="noteref_1773" name="noteref_1773" href="#note_1773"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1773</span></span></a> and they

was fostered and confirmed by the many occasions on which the public
manners prescribed ridicule as a means of
improvement:<a id="noteref_1775" name="noteref_1775" href="#note_1775"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1775</span></span></a>

to endure ridicule was considered the mark of a Lacedæmonian
spirit; yet any person who took it ill might
ask his antagonist to desist, who was then forced to
comply.<a id="noteref_1778" name="noteref_1778" href="#note_1778"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1778</span></span></a> In early times, similar customs existed in
other places besides Sparta; thus the suitors of Agariste,
in the house of Cleisthenes the tyrant of Sicyon,
contended after the meal in musical skill and conversation,<a id="noteref_1779" name="noteref_1779" href="#note_1779"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1779</span></span></a>
with which we might perhaps compare the
passage in the Hymn to Mercury, where it is said that
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page391">[pg 391]</span><a name="Pg391" id="Pg391" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">youths at table attack one another in mutual

been retained longer in Sparta than elsewhere, it struck
all foreigners as a peculiarity, of which the antique
polish was sometimes rather offensive. Still, if we
justly estimate the manners of that city, they do not
deserve the name of needless austerity and strictness;
it was the only Greek state in which a statue was

3. This national mode of expression had likewise
a considerable effect on the progress of literature in
Greece. Plato properly calls the Seven Sages, imitators
and scholars of the Lacedæmonian system, and
points out the resemblance between their sayings and
the Laconian method of expression.<a id="noteref_1785" name="noteref_1785" href="#note_1785"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1785</span></span></a> Of these, three,

of Doric descent, and Cheilon was a Spartan;<a id="noteref_1786" name="noteref_1786" href="#note_1786"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1786</span></span></a> there
were also perhaps at the same time others of the same

to these sages were not so much the discoveries
of particular individuals, as the indications of the general
opinion of their contemporaries. And hence the Pythian
Apollo, directed by the national ideas of the Dorians,
particularly countenanced their philosophers, to
whose sententious mode of expression his own oracles

4. Since in this apophthegmatic and concise style
of speaking the object was not to express the meaning
in a clear and intelligible manner, it was only one
step further altogether to conceal it. Hence the

5. This leads us to speak of the symbolical maxims
of the Pythagoreans, which might be called riddles, if
they had been proposed as such, and not put in that
form merely to make them more striking and impressive.
So attached indeed do these philosophers appear
to have been to the symbolical method of expression,

Pythagoras doubtless brought with him to
Croton the form of his philosophy, its subsequent expansion
and growth were in great part owing to the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page394">[pg 394]</span><a name="Pg394" id="Pg394" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
character of the Dorians and Doric Achæans, among
whom he lived. Its connexion with the chief branch of the Doric religion,
the worship of Apollo,<a id="noteref_1799" name="noteref_1799" href="#note_1799"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1799</span></span></a> and his

has been already pointed out; and
it has been shown that the political institution of his
league was founded on Doric
principles.<a id="noteref_1801" name="noteref_1801" href="#note_1801"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1801</span></span></a> Other

Phintys, and Arignote,<a id="noteref_1802" name="noteref_1802" href="#note_1802"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1802</span></span></a> the employment of music to
appease passion, the public tables, the use of silence
as a means of education, &amp;c. It appears also, that
the philosophers of this school always found a welcome
reception at Sparta, as well as those whose character
was somewhat similar, as the enthusiastic and religious
sages, Abaris,<a id="noteref_1803" name="noteref_1803" href="#note_1803"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1803</span></span></a> Epimenides,<a id="noteref_1804" name="noteref_1804" href="#note_1804"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1804</span></span></a> and Pherecydes;<a id="noteref_1805" name="noteref_1805" href="#note_1805"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1805</span></span></a> Anaximander<a id="noteref_1806" name="noteref_1806" href="#note_1806"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1806</span></span></a>
likewise and Anaximenes<a id="noteref_1807" name="noteref_1807" href="#note_1807"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1807</span></span></a> lived for some
time in that city, and lastly, in the lists of the Pythagorean
philosophers (which are not <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">entirely</span></em> devoid of
credit), there are, besides Italian Greeks, generally
Lacedæmonians, Argives, Sicyonians, Phliasians, and
sometimes women of Sparta, Argos, and Phlius.<a id="noteref_1808" name="noteref_1808" href="#note_1808"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1808</span></span></a>

And this is a fresh confirmation of the position, which
we have frequently maintained, that up to the time of
the Persian war all mental excellence, so far from
being banished from Sparta, flourished there in the
utmost perfection.

1. After Anacharsis the Scythian had visited the
different states of Greece, and lived among them all,
he is reported to have said, that <span class="tei tei-q">“all wanted leisure
and tranquillity for wisdom, except the Lacedæmonians,
for that these were the only persons with
whom it was possible to hold a rational conversation.”</span><a id="noteref_1809" name="noteref_1809" href="#note_1809"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1809</span></span></a> The life of all the other Greeks had doubtless
appeared to him as a restless and unquiet existence,
as a constant struggle and effort without any object.
In addition to the love of ease, which belonged to the
original constitution of the Dorians, there was a further
cause for this mode of life, viz. the entire exemption
from necessary labour which the Spartans enjoyed,
their wants being supplied by the dependent and industrious
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page396">[pg 396]</span><a name="Pg396" id="Pg396" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
classes.<a id="noteref_1810" name="noteref_1810" href="#note_1810"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1810</span></span></a> Several writers have dwelt on the
tedium and listlessness of such an existence; but the
Spartans considered an immunity from labour an immunity
from pain, and as constituting entire liberty.<a id="noteref_1811" name="noteref_1811" href="#note_1811"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1811</span></span></a>

Spartan men from morning to night?<a id="noteref_1812" name="noteref_1812" href="#note_1812"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1812</span></span></a> In
the first place, the gymnastic, military, and musical exercises;
then the chase, which with men advanced in life was
a substitute for other exercises;<a id="noteref_1813" name="noteref_1813" href="#note_1813"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1813</span></span></a> besides which,
there was the management of public affairs, in which they
might take an active part, together with the religious
ceremonies, sacrifices, and choruses; and much time
was also consumed in the places of public resort, or
λέσχαι. Every small community had its

and here the old men sat together in winter round the
blazing fire, while the respect for old age gave an
agreeable turn to the conversation. At Athens, too,
these small societies or clubs were once in great vogue;
but a democracy likes a large mass, and hates all divisions;
and accordingly in later times the public
porticoes and open market were generally attended,
where every Athenian appeared once in the day. At
Sparta, the youths were forbidden to enter the market-place;<a id="noteref_1815" name="noteref_1815" href="#note_1815"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1815</span></span></a> as well as the pylæa,<a id="noteref_1816" name="noteref_1816" href="#note_1816"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1816</span></span></a> which was in other

2. Having now so fully investigated the manners
and daily occupations of the Dorians, it would be interesting
to know what were their opinions on death,
or on the existence of a future state; but on these
points there is no information to be gleaned from
ancient writers. Nor can much more be said on their
funeral ceremonies, if indeed they had any rites peculiar
and universally belonging to the whole race.
At Tarentum, the dead were, according to an ancient
oracle, called the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">majority</span></em> (οἱ πλείονες);<a id="noteref_1819" name="noteref_1819" href="#note_1819"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1819</span></span></a> they were
buried within the walls, each family having in their
house tombstones, with the names of the deceased,
where funeral sacrifices were performed;<a id="noteref_1820" name="noteref_1820" href="#note_1820"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1820</span></span></a> at Sparta, it was doubtless the ancient custom to bury the dead
in the city, and in the neighbourhood of the temples.<a id="noteref_1821" name="noteref_1821" href="#note_1821"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1821</span></span></a>
Monuments, with the names of the dead, were only
erected to those who had fallen in battle,<a id="noteref_1822" name="noteref_1822" href="#note_1822"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1822</span></span></a> and many
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page398">[pg 398]</span><a name="Pg398" id="Pg398" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
other honours were also paid them.<a id="noteref_1823" name="noteref_1823" href="#note_1823"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1823</span></span></a> The sacrifice to
Demeter, on the twelfth day after death, evidently
denotes the reception of the soul in the infernal
regions; the Argives likewise sacrificed on the 30th
day to Hermes, as conductor of the souls of the dead;<a id="noteref_1824" name="noteref_1824" href="#note_1824"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1824</span></span></a>
in the same manner that the Athenians called the dead
Δημητριακοὶ, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> returned to their mother earth.
There was however a considerable difference between
the Athenian and Doric modes of burying; for the
former laid the body with the head to the west, the
latter, at least the Megarians, to the east.<a id="noteref_1825" name="noteref_1825" href="#note_1825"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1825</span></span></a>

3. It now remains for us to collect into one point
of view all that has been said in different parts of this
work on the character of the Doric race, so as to
furnish a complete and accurate idea of their nature
and peculiarities. That this cannot be done in a few
words is evident; but that it can be done <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">at all</span></em>, I
consider equally clear; and by no means agree with
those who deny that a whole nation, like an individual,
can have one character; an error which is perhaps
best refuted by consideration of the different tribes of
Greece. And thus the word <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dorian</span></span> conveyed to the
ancient Greeks a clear and definite, though indeed a
complex idea.<a id="noteref_1826" name="noteref_1826" href="#note_1826"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1826</span></span></a>
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page399">[pg 399]</span><a name="Pg399" id="Pg399" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The first feature in the character of the Dorians
which we shall notice is one that has been pointed out
in several places,<a id="noteref_1827" name="noteref_1827" href="#note_1827"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1827</span></span></a> viz. their endeavour to
produce uniformity and unity in a numerous body. Every
individual was to remain within those limits which
were prescribed by the regulation of the whole
body.<a id="noteref_1828" name="noteref_1828" href="#note_1828"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1828</span></span></a>
Thus in the Doric form of government no individual
was allowed to strive after personal independence, nor
any class or order to move from its appointed place.
The privileges of the aristocracy, and the subjection
of the inferior orders, were maintained with greater
strictness than in other
tribes,<a id="noteref_1829" name="noteref_1829" href="#note_1829"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1829</span></span></a> and greater importance
was attached to obedience, in whatever form, than to
the assertion of individual freedom. The government,
the army, and the public education, were managed on
a most complicated, but most regular succession and
alternation of commanding and
obeying.<a id="noteref_1830" name="noteref_1830" href="#note_1830"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1830</span></span></a> Every one
was to obey in his own place. All the smaller associations
were also regulated on the same principle:
always we find gradation of power, and never independent
equality.<a id="noteref_1831" name="noteref_1831" href="#note_1831"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1831</span></span></a>
But it was not sufficient that this
system should be complete and perfect within; it was
to be fortified without. The Dorians had little inclination
to admit the customs of others, and a strong
desire to disconnect themselves with foreigners.<a id="noteref_1832" name="noteref_1832" href="#note_1832"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1832</span></span></a>
Hence in later times the blunt and harsh deportment
of those Dorians who most scrupulously adhered to
their national habits.<a id="noteref_1833" name="noteref_1833" href="#note_1833"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1833</span></span></a> This independence and seclusion
would however sometimes be turned into hostility;
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page400">[pg 400]</span><a name="Pg400" id="Pg400" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and hence the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">military</span></em> turn of the Dorians, which
may also be traced in the development of the worship
of Apollo.<a id="noteref_1834" name="noteref_1834" href="#note_1834"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1834</span></span></a> A calm and steady courage was the
natural quality of the
Dorian.<a id="noteref_1835" name="noteref_1835" href="#note_1835"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1835</span></span></a> As they were not
ready to receive, neither were they to communicate
outward impressions; and this, neither as individuals,
nor as a body. Hence both in their poetry and prose,
the narrative is often concealed by expressions of
the feeling, and tinged with the colour of the mind.<a id="noteref_1836" name="noteref_1836" href="#note_1836"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1836</span></span></a>
They endeavoured always to condense and concentrate
their thoughts, which was the cause of the great brevity
and obscurity of their
language.<a id="noteref_1837" name="noteref_1837" href="#note_1837"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1837</span></span></a> Their desire
of disconnecting themselves with the things and persons
around them, naturally produced a love for past
times; and hence their great attachment to the usages
and manners of their ancestors, and to ancient institutions.<a id="noteref_1838" name="noteref_1838" href="#note_1838"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1838</span></span></a>
The attention of the Doric race was turned
to the past rather than to the
future.<a id="noteref_1839" name="noteref_1839" href="#note_1839"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1839</span></span></a> And thus it
came to pass that the Dorians preserved most rigidly,
and represented most truly, the customs of the ancient
Greeks.<a id="noteref_1840" name="noteref_1840" href="#note_1840"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1840</span></span></a> Their advances were constant, not sudden;
and all their changes imperceptible. With the desire
to attain uniformity, their love for <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">measure</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">proportion</span></em>
was also combined. Their works of art are
distinguished by this attention to singleness of effect,
and everything discordant or useless was pruned off
with an unsparing hand.<a id="noteref_1841" name="noteref_1841" href="#note_1841"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1841</span></span></a> Their moral system
also prescribed the observance of the proper mean;
and it was in this that the temperance (σωφροσύνη)
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page401">[pg 401]</span><a name="Pg401" id="Pg401" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
which so distinguished them
consisted.<a id="noteref_1842" name="noteref_1842" href="#note_1842"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1842</span></span></a> One great
object of the worship of Apollo was to maintain the
even balance of the mind, and to remove everything
that might disquiet the thoughts, rouse the mind to
passion, or dim its purity and brightness.<a id="noteref_1843" name="noteref_1843" href="#note_1843"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1843</span></span></a> The Doric
nature required an equal and regular harmony, and
preserving that character in all its parts.<a id="noteref_1844" name="noteref_1844" href="#note_1844"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1844</span></span></a> Dissonances,
even if they combined into harmony, were
not suited to the taste of that nation. The national
tunes were doubtless not of a soft or pleasing melody;
the general accent of the language had the character
of command or dictation, not of question or entreaty.
The Dorians were contented with themselves,
with the powers to whom they owed their existence
and happiness; and therefore they never complained.
They looked not to future, but to present existence.
To preserve this, and to preserve it in enjoyment,
was their highest object. Everything beyond this
boundary was mist and darkness, and everything
dark they supposed the Deity to hate.<a id="noteref_1845" name="noteref_1845" href="#note_1845"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1845</span></span></a> They lived in themselves, and for themselves.<a id="noteref_1846" name="noteref_1846" href="#note_1846"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1846</span></span></a> Hence man was
the chief and almost only object which attracted their
attention. The same feelings may also be perceived
in their religion, which was always unconnected with
the worship of any natural object, and originated from
their own reflection and conceptions.<a id="noteref_1847" name="noteref_1847" href="#note_1847"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1847</span></span></a> And to the
same source may perhaps be traced their aversion to
mechanical and agricultural
labour.<a id="noteref_1848" name="noteref_1848" href="#note_1848"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1848</span></span></a> In short, the
whole race bears generally the stamp and character of
the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">male sex</span></em>; the desire of assistance and connexion,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page402">[pg 402]</span><a name="Pg402" id="Pg402" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of novelty and of curiosity, the characteristics of the
female sex, being directly opposed to the nature of the
Dorians, which bears the mark of independence and
subdued strength.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. This description of the Doric character, to which
many other features might be added, is sufficient for
our present purpose; and will serve to prove that the
worship of Apollo, the ancient constitution of Crete
and that of Lycurgus, the manners, arts, and literature
of the Dorians, were the productions of one and the
same national individual. To what extent this character
was influenced by external circumstances cannot
be ascertained; but though its features were impressed
by nature, they might not in all places have been developed,
and would have been lost without the fostering
assistance of an inland and mountainous region.
The country is to a nation what the body is to the
soul: it may influence it partially, and assist its growth
and increase; but it cannot give strength and impulse,
or imprint that original mark of the Deity which is set
upon our minds.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But outward circumstances, such as locality, form
of government, geographical position, and foreign
intercourse, had in the several states a different effect
on the Doric character, unequally developing its
various features, by confirming some, repressing others,
and some wholly obliterating. We shall thus be enabled
to separate the particular character of each state
from the ideal character of the whole race, and also to
explain their deviations, particularly in a political and
practical point of view.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
5. The Dorians of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Sparta</span></span> were influenced by
their geographical position, which, with the exception
of that of the Arcadians, was more inland than that of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page403">[pg 403]</span><a name="Pg403" id="Pg403" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
any people in Peloponnesus; as well as by their
supremacy, which they at first asserted with ease and
dignity, and afterwards maintained by the devotion of
all their forces to that one object. The independence
and seclusion so desired by the Dorians were at Sparta
most conspicuous, and thus the original spirit of the
Doric race, and its ancient customs, were most rigidly,
and sometimes even in trifles,<a id="noteref_1849" name="noteref_1849" href="#note_1849"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1849</span></span></a> there preserved;
though it was the mummy rather than the living body
of the ancient institutions. This deterioration, however,
did not manifest itself till later times; for (as we have
more than once remarked) at an early period the mode
of life at Sparta was diversified, cheerful, and by no
means unattractive. At that time Sparta was the
centre and metropolis of Greece. This love of seclusion
took a singular turn in the reserve, and in the
short and sententious mode of expression, practised
by the Laconians. Indeed their silence was carried
to a pitch which exceeded the bounds of intentional
concealment. Even the artfulness of the Spartans is
after the Persian war often mentioned with blame;
and it is said to have been impossible to guess their
intention.<a id="noteref_1850" name="noteref_1850" href="#note_1850"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1850</span></span></a> Sometimes indeed the deception was
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page404">[pg 404]</span><a name="Pg404" id="Pg404" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
founded on patriotic principles, as in the answer of
the ambassador, who being asked in whose name he
came, replied, <span class="tei tei-q">“In the name of the state, if we succeed;
if we fail, in our own.”</span> Demostratus the
son of Phæax said with great truth that the Spartans
were better as members of a state, the Athenians as
members of private society;<a id="noteref_1851" name="noteref_1851" href="#note_1851"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1851</span></span></a> the latter indeed were
more left to their individual care and exertions, whilst
the former were guided by national custom. Hence
when they once deserted this guide, they deviated
not partially, but wholly and widely from the right
path.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Yet the history of the Peloponnesian war and of
the period immediately following, being that part of
the history of Greece which is clearest to our view,
presents several distinguished and genuine Lacedæmonians,
who may be divided into two distinct classes.
Of these the first is marked by a cunning and artful
disposition, combined with great vigour of mind, and
a patriotism sometimes attended with contempt of
other Greeks. Such was
Lysander,<a id="noteref_1852" name="noteref_1852" href="#note_1852"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1852</span></span></a> a powerful revolutionist;
who, concentrating in his own person the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page405">[pg 405]</span><a name="Pg405" id="Pg405" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
efforts of numerous oligarchical clubs and factions,
by the strict consistency of his principles, and by his
art in carrying them into effect, for some time swayed
the destinies of Greece; until Agesilaus, whom he
had himself improvidently raised to the throne, restored
in place of his usurped power the legitimate authority
of the Heraclide dynasty; this doubtless suggested to
Lysander the idea of overthrowing the royal authority,
and helped to bring on that deep melancholy which
preyed upon his strong mind during his latter years.<a id="noteref_1853" name="noteref_1853" href="#note_1853"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1853</span></span></a> Similar in character to Lysander was Dercylidas, a
man of extraordinary practical talent; who by his
artfulness (which, however, was accompanied by uprightness
of mind) obtained the nickname of Sisyphus.<a id="noteref_1854" name="noteref_1854" href="#note_1854"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1854</span></span></a>
But Sparta had at the same time men of
a contrary disposition, in whom, as Plutarch says of
Callicratidas, the simple and genuine Doric manners
of ancient times were alive and in vigour.<a id="noteref_1855" name="noteref_1855" href="#note_1855"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1855</span></span></a> This
Callicratidas had at the very beginning of his career to
contend with his partisans of Lysander, and resolutely
resisted his club or association,<a id="noteref_1856" name="noteref_1856" href="#note_1856"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1856</span></span></a> being also directly
opposed to them in disposition. He deplored the
necessity which compelled him to beg for subsidies
from the Persians; dealt uprightly and honestly with
the allies; disdained all power and authority which
did not emanate from the state; refused to do anything
by private connexions or influence, and showed
himself everywhere humane, magnanimous, and heroic;
in short, he was a faultless hero, unless perhaps we
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page406">[pg 406]</span><a name="Pg406" id="Pg406" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
should blame him for his too hasty self-immolation at
the battle of Arginusæ.<a id="noteref_1857" name="noteref_1857" href="#note_1857"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1857</span></span></a> We can easily
understand how the Greeks of Asia should have admired the
virtues and greatness of the youthful hero, like the
beauty of an heroic statue,<a id="noteref_1858" name="noteref_1858" href="#note_1858"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1858</span></span></a> but were at the
same time more pleased with the proceedings of Lysander, as
being better suited to the times. In Brasidas we
admire chiefly the manner in which the same elevation
of mind was combined with a particular skill in controlling
and availing itself of the circumstances of the
times; but we must hurry on to Pedaritus the son of
Teleutia, who is an instance that all the harmosts of
Sparta did not yield to the many temptations of their
situation.<a id="noteref_1859" name="noteref_1859" href="#note_1859"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1859</span></span></a> But a more singular character was Lichas,
the son of Arcesilaus, of whom we will give a slight
sketch. He was chiefly distinguished by his liberality:
whence by means of great banquets at the
Gymnopædia,<a id="noteref_1860" name="noteref_1860" href="#note_1860"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1860</span></span></a> and by his victories in the chariot race
at Olympia,<a id="noteref_1861" name="noteref_1861" href="#note_1861"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1861</span></span></a> he increased the fame of his city; by his
boldness, which was even shown in his conduct at
Olympia, at a time when the Spartans were excluded
from the contests;<a id="noteref_1862" name="noteref_1862" href="#note_1862"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1862</span></span></a> but which was
still more conspicuous in his truly Spartan declaration to the satrap
Tissaphernes;<a id="noteref_1863" name="noteref_1863" href="#note_1863"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1863</span></span></a> and, lastly, by his policy in
endeavouring to prevent the premature aggression of the Ionians
against the Persians.<a id="noteref_1864" name="noteref_1864" href="#note_1864"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1864</span></span></a>

6. The flourishing age of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Crete</span></span>, in manners as
well as in power, is anterior to the historical period;
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page407">[pg 407]</span><a name="Pg407" id="Pg407" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and the early corruption of her ancient institutions
was accompanied with universal barbarism and degeneracy.
Of her maritime sovereignty of the mythical
age nothing but piracy remained; the different states
were not combined under the supremacy of a single
city; and, even in the reign of Alcamenes, Sparta
attempted to settle the mutual dissensions of those
very cities<a id="noteref_1865" name="noteref_1865" href="#note_1865"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1865</span></span></a> which it had a century before taken
for the models of its own constitution. The Cretans did
not, however, confine their quarrelsome disposition to
domestic feuds; but they began in early times to hire
themselves as mercenaries to foreign states, which was
certainly one cause of the internal corruption that
made this once illustrious island act so ignoble a part
in the history of Greece. If the verse of Epimenides
(cited by St. Paul<a id="noteref_1866" name="noteref_1866" href="#note_1866"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1866</span></span></a>) is genuine, that prophet so early
as about 600 B.C. accused his countrymen of being
habitual liars, evil beasts, and indolent gluttons. Yet
some particular cities (among which we may especially
mention the Spartan town of Lyctus) retained with
their ancient institutions the noble and pure customs
of better times.<a id="noteref_1867" name="noteref_1867" href="#note_1867"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1867</span></span></a>

We have already more than once had occasion to
explain how about the time of the Persian war <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Argos</span></span>,
by the changes in its constitution, and the direction of
its policy, succeeded in obliterating almost every trace
of the Doric character:<a id="noteref_1868" name="noteref_1868" href="#note_1868"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1868</span></span></a> but one revolution only led
to another, and none produced a stable and healthy
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page408">[pg 408]</span><a name="Pg408" id="Pg408" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
state of affairs. Argos indeed only adopted the worst
part of the republican institutions of Athens; for their
better parts could not be naturalized in a people of a
race and nature totally different.<a id="noteref_1869" name="noteref_1869" href="#note_1869"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1869</span></span></a>

But that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Rhodes</span></span> preserved to the latest period of
Grecian independence many features of the Doric
character we have already
remarked.<a id="noteref_1870" name="noteref_1870" href="#note_1870"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1870</span></span></a> Still this
island had, particularly in the time of Artemisia the
Second, adopted many Asiatic customs; which, when
mixed with those of a Greek origin, formed a peculiar
compound; of which the Rhodian oratory, painting,<a id="noteref_1871" name="noteref_1871" href="#note_1871"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1871</span></span></a>
and sculpture, should be considered as the products.
The latter art had flourished there from ancient times;
but later it took a particular turn towards the colossal,
the imposing, and the grand style. The Laocoon and
the Toro Farnese are in the number of its finest productions.<a id="noteref_1872" name="noteref_1872" href="#note_1872"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1872</span></span></a>
Its manners are described by the saying
that Rhodes was the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">town of wooers</span></span>. There was also
another proverb, that the Rhodians were <span class="tei tei-q">“white Cyrenæans;”</span>

The character of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Corinth</span></span> likewise, in the time of
the Peloponnesian war, was made up of rather discordant
elements; for while there were still considerable
remains of the Doric disposition, and its political conduct
was some time guided by the principles of that
race, there was also, the consequence of its situation
and trade,<a id="noteref_1874" name="noteref_1874" href="#note_1874"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1874</span></span></a> a great bias to splendour and magnificence,

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Syracuse</span></span>, though highly distinguished for its
loyalty and affection to its mother-state, necessarily
deviated widely from the character of Corinth. For
while in the narrow and rocky territory of Corinth
the crops were with difficulty extorted from the soil,<a id="noteref_1877" name="noteref_1877" href="#note_1877"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1877</span></span></a>
in the colony, a large and fertile district, which was
either held by the Syracusans, or was tributary to
them, furnished to an over-peopled city a plentiful
supply of provisions without foreign importation.<a id="noteref_1878" name="noteref_1878" href="#note_1878"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1878</span></span></a>
In addition to this abundance, the early preponderance of
democracy, and still more the levity, cunning, and
address which were natural to the people of Sicily,
tended to modify, or partly to destroy, the original
Doric character. The Syracusans were, according to
Thucydides, among all the adversaries of the Athenians
in the Peloponnesian war, most like them in
their customs and disposition.<a id="noteref_1879" name="noteref_1879" href="#note_1879"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1879</span></span></a> It is ever to be

and guiding judgment: their most frequent error
both in the state and army being a want of order<a id="noteref_1880" name="noteref_1880" href="#note_1880"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1880</span></span></a>;
and their knowledge of this defect was the reason why
they so frequently threw themselves blindly into the
arms of single individuals.<a id="noteref_1881" name="noteref_1881" href="#note_1881"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1881</span></span></a>

influence on <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Sicyon</span></span>; yet that city, though it had a

closer connexion between them than was actually the

correct; though that historian is accused of too great
a fondness for censure. Damon likewise relates, that
the Byzantians were so addicted to the pleasures of the
table, that the citizens took up their regular abode in
the numerous public houses of the city, and let their
houses with their wives to strangers. The sound of
the flute put them immediately into a merry movement;
but they fled from that of a trumpet: and a
general had no other means of keeping them on the
ramparts during a close siege, than by causing the
public houses and cook-shops to be removed thither.<a id="noteref_1892" name="noteref_1892" href="#note_1892"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1892</span></span></a>

its political existence. Its situation near the great
commercial road, which had taken this course chiefly
in consequence of the danger of doubling the promontory

a very considerable share in changing the characters
of these two cities; as the Tarentines did not subjugate

up to the time of that author the purest Doric
that was spoken in Peloponnesus. The reason of
this either was, that the Helots who remained in the
country, and doubtless formed the larger part of the
new nation, had obtained the Doric character, or that
the exiles had during their long banishment really
preserved their ancient language, as we know to have
been the case with the Naupactians in more ancient
times.<a id="noteref_1902" name="noteref_1902" href="#note_1902"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1902</span></span></a> This the Messenians, who dwelt

Since we have frequently considered <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Delphi</span></span> as
belonging to the number of the Doric cities, on a
supposition that it was the seat of an ancient Doric
nobility (although the people was chiefly formed of
naturalized slaves of the temple), we have finally to
observe on the character of the Delphians, that their
early degeneracy (which even Æsop is said to have
strongly reproved) is a phenomenon which has frequently
taken place among the people residing in
the immediate neighbourhood of national sanctuaries.

discovered in the events of earlier times.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. The ancient grammarians divided the Greek language
into four distinct branches—the Doric, Ionic, Attic, and
Æolic; the latter including all dialects not comprised
under the other three heads, because only one branch of it,
the Lesbian, was the written language of one species of
poetry: and yet this latter division must unquestionably
have contained different species less connected with each
other than with some branches of the other three dialects.
It is, however, pretty well agreed that the several Æolic
dialects together contained more remains of the primitive
Grecian or (if we will so call it) Pelasgic language, than
either the Doric, Ionic, or Attic; and that at the same time
many forms of the latter were preserved with great fidelity
in the Latin tongue; partly because the life of the Italian
husbandmen bore a nearer resemblance to that of the ancient
Greeks than that of the later Greeks themselves, and because
neither their literature, nor any fastidious sense of
euphony and rhythm, induced them to soften and refine
their language. But of the more polished dialects, that of
Homer, though differing in many points, yet in others
doubtless closely resembled the original language, which
must once have been spoken from Thessaly to Peloponnesus,
and was variously metamorphosed in the Doric, Ionic,
and Attic dialects. Thus, for example, the genitive case of
the second declension, in the ancient form, was ΟΙΟ, which
was preserved in the Thessalian dialect,<a id="noteref_1907" name="noteref_1907" href="#note_1907"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1907</span></span></a> perhaps also in
the Bœotian,<a id="noteref_1908" name="noteref_1908" href="#note_1908"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1908</span></span></a> and in Latin I or EI is also perceivable;
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page418">[pg 418]</span><a name="Pg418" id="Pg418" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
whilst in the Doric Ω and the Attic ΟΥ this vowel was entirely
lost. The nominative of masculines of the first declension
in Α belongs to the Latin, Homeric, Dryopian,
Thessalian, Bœotian, Macedonian, and Elean dialects. In
the Doric it was probably of rare occurrence, and more
accidental.<a id="noteref_1909" name="noteref_1909" href="#note_1909"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1909</span></span></a>
The Æolic dialect, which was spoken in Bœotia,
likewise contains remarkable traces of an ancient Pelasgic
language, and has striking coincidences with the Latin:
thus in the ancient Bœotian inscriptions the dative of the
first declension ends in ΑΕ. Gradually, however, it departed
from this language, as the diphthongs ΑΙ and ΟΙ,
which anciently were written ΑΕ and ΟΕ, were changed
into Η and Υ: and thus almost all the vowels and diphthongs
received a new form. On the other hand, we must be
cautious of supposing the Latin to be the ancient form, in
cases where a transmutation of letters has already taken
place. The following is a remarkable example to this effect.
ΟΠΩ, from whence <span class="tei tei-q">“the eye,”</span> ὄππα in the Æolic dialect,<a id="noteref_1910" name="noteref_1910" href="#note_1910"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1910</span></span></a> ὄφθος in the Elean,<a id="noteref_1911" name="noteref_1911" href="#note_1911"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1911</span></span></a> ὄπτιλος in the Spartan. In other dialect,
ὄκκος, hence ὄκταλλος in the Bœotian, in the Latin
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">oculus</span></span>,
where Π and Κ bear the same relation to each other as
in the words πέτυρες (Æolic) <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">quatuor</span></span>,
πέμπτος, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">quintus</span></span>, ποῖ,
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">quo</span></span>, πόθι,
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">alicubi</span></span>. Moreover the Latin has a very large
number of words derived from the Campanian and Doric
Greeks, which must be distinguished from the primitive
Greek dialect.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. These remarks are merely premised in order to point
out the authorities upon which all investigations into the
form of the most ancient language of the Greeks should be
founded. We have already intimated our dissent from
those who, in opposition to Pausanias,<a id="noteref_1912" name="noteref_1912" href="#note_1912"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1912</span></span></a> suppose the
Doric to have been the native dialect of Peloponnesus, not only
disallowing the claim of the Dorians to its introduction, but
even denying that they were the first to adopt it. This
supposition would leave us without any means of explaining
how the dialect of the Dorians of Peloponnesus agreed
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page419">[pg 419]</span><a name="Pg419" id="Pg419" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in so many peculiar idioms with that of their fellow-countrymen
in Crete, the close and general connexion between
the two being of an earlier date than the Doric invasion
of Peloponnesus. The ancient Peloponnesian dialect was
certainly that language which may be recognized in the
Latin and in Homer, many of the peculiarities of which
occur indeed, but many of the most essential are not found,
in the Doric dialect. This latter dialect was, however, very
widely diffused over that peninsula by the preponderance
of the Dorians, being not merely adopted by the Helots
(who even at Naupactus spoke Doric), the Orneatæ,<a id="noteref_1913" name="noteref_1913" href="#note_1913"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1913</span></span></a> the Laconian Periœci, and the Attic inhabitants of
Colonides;<a id="noteref_1914" name="noteref_1914" href="#note_1914"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1914</span></span></a>
but even by the independent Arcadians, who, according to
Strabo, used indeed the Æolic dialect, but were generally
supposed to adopt the Doric (δωρίζειν), as also did Philopœmen.<a id="noteref_1915" name="noteref_1915" href="#note_1915"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1915</span></span></a>
Unfortunately we have little information respecting
the dialect of the Arcadians, our chief guide being the
names of their towns, in which several Dorisms occur; as,
for instance, Καφυαὶ (from Κηφεὺς), Νᾶσοι, Ἀνεμῶσα (ἀνεμόεσσα),
and some anomalous forms, such as Λαδοκέα for
Λαοδικέα, Θελποῦσα for Τιλφοῦσσα, Dor. Τιλφῶσσα, Κραρεῶτις,
a tribe of Tegea, for Κλαρεῶτις.<a id="noteref_1916" name="noteref_1916" href="#note_1916"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1916</span></span></a> The
Eleans, on the other hand, spoke nearly pure Doric; which is shown
indeed by their use of the digamma,<a id="noteref_1917" name="noteref_1917" href="#note_1917"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1917</span></span></a> by their broad accent,
and the Ω in the genitive case; but chiefly by the frequent
use of Ρ, which, besides the ΤΟΙΡ, ΤΙΡ in the well-known
treaty of the Eleans,<a id="noteref_1918" name="noteref_1918" href="#note_1918"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1918</span></span></a> is also
proved by the Elean forms δίκαρ (for δίκας or δικαστὴς), οὗτορ, ἵππορ and similar forms,
whence the Eleans were called βαρβαρόφωνοι.<a id="noteref_1919" name="noteref_1919" href="#note_1919"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1919</span></span></a> Moreover,
the Apollo Θέρμιος of the Eleans was the same as Apollo
Θέσμιος, in Attic Greek.<a id="noteref_1920" name="noteref_1920" href="#note_1920"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1920</span></span></a> Eretria was
founded by Eleans in conjunction with other Greeks, whence the frequent
use of the Ρ in that town;<a id="noteref_1921" name="noteref_1921" href="#note_1921"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1921</span></span></a> and from this city the neighbouring
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page420">[pg 420]</span><a name="Pg420" id="Pg420" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Chalcideans also adopted it;<a id="noteref_1922" name="noteref_1922" href="#note_1922"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1922</span></span></a> whilst among
the Carystians another peculiarity of the Spartan Elean dialect
prevailed, in the change of Θ into Σ.<a id="noteref_1923" name="noteref_1923" href="#note_1923"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1923</span></span></a> The Eretrians, however,
received from the Eleans another peculiarity of the
pure Doric, viz. the use of the aspirate in the place of Σ;
and imparted it to the Oropians, their neighbours, and
sometimes their subjects, on the other side of the
strait.<a id="noteref_1924" name="noteref_1924" href="#note_1924"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1924</span></span></a>
Thus it is evident that the dialect of the Eleans was very
similar, nay, almost akin, to the Spartan. Now it is very
improbable that this strict observance of the Doric dialect
should have been learnt by mere intercourse, since on no
side were they in immediate contact with Dorians. It is
much more probable that the Ætolians, who conquered
Elis, used, from their vicinity to the Dorians, the same dialect:
that they spoke Doric in later times, is proved by the
testimony of ancient authors and monuments
extant;<a id="noteref_1925" name="noteref_1925" href="#note_1925"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1925</span></span></a> and
the same was also the language of the inhabitants of the
ancient Epirus Proper.<a id="noteref_1926" name="noteref_1926" href="#note_1926"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1926</span></span></a> It seems, therefore, that this dialect
was formed in the northern and mountainous districts
of Greece, particularly in the vicinity of mount Pindus,
from whence the Dorians brought it in their migration to the
more southern parts of the country, where they were in consequence
commonly regarded as the race with whom it first
originated.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. To determine with any degree of precision how much
climate and the nature of the soil contributed to the formation
of this dialect, would be a matter of extreme difficulty;
although the comparison of the corresponding dialects of
different languages with the various localities in which each
was formed may lead to several interesting observations.
There can be no doubt that a mountain life is favourable to
the formation of the pure, broad, and long vowels, such as
Α and Ω; as also that a residence in the lowlands and on
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page421">[pg 421]</span><a name="Pg421" id="Pg421" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the coast produces rather modifications of the long
vowels<a id="noteref_1927" name="noteref_1927" href="#note_1927"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1927</span></span></a>
and short syllables. It should, however, be borne in mind,
that the influence of these causes upon language was in full
operation at one period only, when the organs generally
evinced greater pliancy in adapting themselves to the various
peculiarities of situation. In later times, Doric was
spoken in maritime towns, as low German is now in mountains
and highlands. We must likewise remember, that not
only the country, but also the people, bore a distinct national
character, the influence of which upon their language
must have been full as great as of the former. The hypothesis
that the ancient dialects were determined more by internal
than external influence, more by the nature of the
men than the influence of place, is confirmed by a remarkable
passage of Jamblichus,<a id="noteref_1928" name="noteref_1928" href="#note_1928"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1928</span></span></a> who had probably
derived this sentiment from the schools of the early Pythagoreans:
he pronounces the Doric dialect to be the most ancient and
best, comparing it, on account of the sounding vowels with
which it abounded, to the enharmonic style of music, as he
does the Ionic and Æolic dialects to the chromatic style.
The only meaning of this remark can be, that the long
vowels Α and Ω were pronounced in as clear and marked
a manner (particularly when, as was often the case, they
were circumflexed) as a bar separated by a double bar in
the tetrachord strung to the enharmonic pitch, so much
used for music of the Doric style.<a id="noteref_1929" name="noteref_1929" href="#note_1929"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1929</span></span></a> Otherwise a manly character
is always attributed to the Doric dialect:<a id="noteref_1930" name="noteref_1930" href="#note_1930"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1930</span></span></a> its fitness
for solemn occasions and simple expression is shown by the
literary remains which have come down to us.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. It cannot be expected that we should here enter into
a minute examination of all the peculiarities of the Doric
dialect: the following brief remarks will, it is hoped, be received
as an attempt rather to set forth the most remarkable
features of the spoken language, than to explain the niceties
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page422">[pg 422]</span><a name="Pg422" id="Pg422" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the polished style used in writing and poetry. The frequent
use of Α prevailed indeed partially in the ancient
dialect, and in most cases the use of Η originated in the
Ionic, which in this respect bore nearly the same relation
to the ancient Greek as the English language does to the
German.<a id="noteref_1931" name="noteref_1931" href="#note_1931"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1931</span></span></a> The broad pronunciation (πλατειασμὸς) of the
Dorians frequently, however, exceeded that of the ancient
language, as may be seen from the Latin. Thus φαγὸς,
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">fagus</span></span>—φάμα,
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">fama</span></span>—μᾶλον,
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">malum</span></span>—ἀρχᾶς,
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">terras</span></span> (genit.)
κᾶρυξ, (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">caduceus</span></span>), and the like, are clearly
the genuine ancient forms. On the other hand, the change from Α to Η
in the temporal augment existed in the most ancient Greek,
as is evident from <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">ago</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">ēgi</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">ἦγον</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">capio</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">cēpi</span></span>, &amp;c. The Doric
dialect, however, here also used Α in the place of Η. I am
not aware whether another change very nearly coinciding
with the latter has ever been noticed, viz. the frequent use
of the short Α for Η, especially in the enclitics, as κᾶ (which
however is long) for κε or ἂν, a form common to all the
Dorians, and in the same manner γα for γε,<a id="noteref_1932" name="noteref_1932" href="#note_1932"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1932</span></span></a> κα for the

took place among the Bœotians), as in ποίη, πλήων, μήων,<a id="noteref_1937" name="noteref_1937" href="#note_1937"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1937</span></span></a>

Sophron,<a id="noteref_1944" name="noteref_1944" href="#note_1944"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1944</span></span></a> and ὅπει in a Corcyrean inscription<a id="noteref_1945" name="noteref_1945" href="#note_1945"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1945</span></span></a> for πῆ and ὄπη,
is a remarkable variety. The Dorians, consistently with their
love for the pure and long Α, were equally partial to the Ω.
This letter frequently forms the original sound, as in the accusative
case Ἀργείως, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Argivos</span></span>; and hence the abbreviated
form θεὸς for θεὼς in Cretan and Coan<a id="noteref_1946" name="noteref_1946" href="#note_1946"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1946</span></span></a> inscriptions, and in
Theocritus, was probably formed by an elision of the characteristic
vowel, as δεσποτᾶς in the first declension. We
frequently also find use made of the vowel Ω as a prolongation
of Ο, instead of the common form ΟΥ, produced by
the elision of consonants: thus in the form of the participle
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page424">[pg 424]</span><a name="Pg424" id="Pg424" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
feminine in ωσα, used in Crete and Peloponnesus, and also
in the Heraclean Tables, whilst the softer form in οισα,
where οι was also derived from οντ (as in the third person
plural ναίοισιν, and in the masculine participle τύψαις), was
perhaps peculiar to Sicily. Ο also, when followed by Ε,
overpowers the latter letter, and is changed into Ω, as for
instance in Κοιλῶσσα (a mountain near Phlius), λωτρὸν, ὑπνῶν
for ὑπνόεν, Laconian forms in Aristophanes, παμῶχος, and
similar words in the Heraclean Tables; though whether this
is the case when the Ε precedes the Ο is doubtful, for in
εὐορκῶσι and similar forms in Cretan inscriptions, it is ΕΩ,
not ΕΟ, which is contracted into Ω. In this case ΕΟ is
generally contracted into ΕΥ, or it is changed into ΙΟ, as
ΕΩ into ΙΩ; thus μογίομες, λυχνοφορίοντες in the Lysistrata
of Aristophanes (according to the old reading), ἐπαινιῶ, ὀμιώμεθα
ib., ανιοχιων for ἡνιοχέων in the Laconian inscription
in Leake, No. 71. with which compare ἐμμενιῶ in the oath
of the Latians, πραξίομεν in the decree of the Istionians, and
παμωχιῶ in the Heraclean Tables.<a id="noteref_1947" name="noteref_1947" href="#note_1947"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1947</span></span></a> In the above cases
there is no reason for assuming any other changes, than from
ΕΟ into ΙΟ and ΕΩ into ΙΩ, as the Dorians appear to have
been very unwilling to tolerate Ε with Ο; the short Ι, however,
before the lengthened Ο must have been particularly
suited to their ears. The long Α in Ἀλκμὰν, Ἀτρείδα,
Ἀγησίλας, πρᾶτος was without doubt a thick sound between
Α and Ο, for which there was no distinct character. The
Spartan dialect frequently has ΟΥ for Υ (which change
regularly occurs in the Bœotian dialect), as δίφουρα for γέφυρα
(Hesychius in v.), φούἱξ for φυσίγξ (Valck. ad Adoniaz,
p. 276.), μουσίδδω for μυθίζω (ibid. p. 279.), φούαξιρ (vol. I.
p. 384. note f.), μοῦκορ for μυχὸς (Koen p. 343.), καμπούληρ,
a species of olive-tree (in Hesychius), derived, I believe,
from κάμπτων ὕλην, κάρουα for κάρυα (Hesych. in v.); οὐδραίνει,
περικαθαίρει according to Hesych. for ὑδραίνει, τούνη
for σὺ (Hesych.), ἀπεσσούα for ἀπεσύν in the letter of Hippocrates
(compare Coray ad Plut. Alcib. 28.). ΟΙ for Υ
is only found in Ποίθιοι, according to Photius.

5. The consonants in the Doric dialect were in some
cases so brought together as to give the words a roughness
which was avoided in other dialects, and consequently it possessed
more of that ancient fulness of consonants which was
preserved with greater fidelity in the Latin language than in
the Greek; partly from the neglect of that law, which was
so constantly observed by all the dialects of the Greek, that
every word should end either with a vowel or semi-vowel.
The Doric has at least the ancient form of the participle
τιθὲνς (Lat. <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ns</span></span>, in ancient Gothic
<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">ants</span></span>), which is quoted as
a Cretan and Argive form;<a id="noteref_1948" name="noteref_1948" href="#note_1948"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1948</span></span></a> and the preposition ἐνς for <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in</span></em>
with the accusative (<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">into</span></em>), which in other dialects was changed
into εἰς; but in the Doric it became, by the omission of the
final Σ, ἐν in the sense of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">into</span></em>, as in
Crete and in Pindar,<a id="noteref_1949" name="noteref_1949" href="#note_1949"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1949</span></span></a>
although Cretan inscriptions of considerable antiquity have
εἰς, which appears to have been the usual Laconian form.
Thus also the Cretans and Argives formed the future in
σπένσω, merely throwing out δ, as a τ is properly omitted in
τιθένς.<a id="noteref_1950" name="noteref_1950" href="#note_1950"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1950</span></span></a> The Rhegians adopted the same usage from the
Messenians.<a id="noteref_1951" name="noteref_1951" href="#note_1951"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1951</span></span></a> It is clear that the organs of the ancient Doric
race were better fitted for this rough pronunciation than the
more delicate ones of the other Greeks, who even changed
the Roman <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Hortensius</span></span> into Ὁρτήσιος. The same
remark may be applied to the word μάκαρς in Alcman (fragm. 66.),
and some similar forms.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Another more striking characteristic of the Doric dialect
is the aversion to Σ, the σὰν κίβδαλον; hence the Doric lyric
poets, Lasus and others, wrote poems without that letter;
a practice in direct contradiction with the partiality shown
by the Ionians for that sound. To this principle may be
traced various other peculiarities: first, the interchange of Σ
and Τ, which, however, is on the whole merely a relic of
the original dialect, as in the adjectives ἐνιαύτιος and
πλούτιος,<a id="noteref_1952" name="noteref_1952" href="#note_1952"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1952</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page426">[pg 426]</span><a name="Pg426" id="Pg426" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in τὺ or τοὺ, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">tu</span></span>, in τέσσαρες,
<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">quatuor</span></span>, in the third persons
δίδωτι, φατὶ, which still retain this form in Sanscrit (while
in the Latin and German languages T is always the last
letter of this third person). Also in the name of Neptune
the Doric was doubtless the original form, having the same
root as πόντος, ποταμός; the original form was Ποτίδας (in
Epicharmus and Sophron<a id="noteref_1953" name="noteref_1953" href="#note_1953"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1953</span></span></a>), and the
Megarian in Aristophanes says Ποτείδας; so also the Corinthians; and hence
their colony Ποτειδαία,<a id="noteref_1954" name="noteref_1954" href="#note_1954"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1954</span></span></a> Ποτειδᾶν (from Ποτειδάων) was the
Spartan and the Rhodian form.<a id="noteref_1955" name="noteref_1955" href="#note_1955"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1955</span></span></a> It is singular that in some
cases the Dorians also used Σ for Τ, as σᾶτες for τῆτες,<a id="noteref_1956" name="noteref_1956" href="#note_1956"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1956</span></span></a>
corresponding to which we find σάμερον in Pindar, Theocritus,
and the Tarentine dialect (a word, according to Hesychius,
synonymous with νῦν); the σὰ for τὰ of the Megarians,
and this latter for τίνα is the same change.<a id="noteref_1957" name="noteref_1957" href="#note_1957"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1957</span></span></a> It was
this aversion to Σ, noticed above, which led the Spartans in
the double consonants ΣΤ, ΣΚ, ΣΠ, to reject the Σ and
double the other consonant; hence the Laconian forms
κτίτταρ for κτίστης, ἐττὰν for ἐς τὰν, ἀμπίτταρ for
ἀμφιστὰς,<a id="noteref_1958" name="noteref_1958" href="#note_1958"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1958</span></span></a>
ἀκκὸρ for ἀσκὸς.<a id="noteref_1959" name="noteref_1959" href="#note_1959"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1959</span></span></a> Valckenær lays down the following rule:
<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">literam</span></span> Σ <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lacones
in sequentem consonantem non liquidam
mutant</span></span>;”</span> and of this change he finds traces in the Tarentine
dialect, to which we may add, that Hecate, according
to Hesychius, was there called ἄφραττος, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> ἄφραστος. The
most interesting example of this change in the Spartan
dialect is the form ἄττασι for ἀνάστηθι (derived from ΑΝΤΤΑΣΙ),
in which word more than three Laconisms are discernible.
With this point is immediately connected the
change of Ζ, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> ΣΔ into ΔΔ, for instance in verbs in ζω,
<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Laconice</span></span>—δδω, many instances of which occur in the
Lysistrata and Acharneans of Aristophanes. There is no
evidence of the same change occurring in verbs whose
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page427">[pg 427]</span><a name="Pg427" id="Pg427" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
characteristic is Γ; although the Dorians were induced by
analogy and a partiality to the letter Ξ to introduce the
termination ξω, where the characteristic letter was not Γ but
Δ, which is evident by the formation of the substantive καθίππαξις
(as should be read in Hesychius for καθίπταξις),
δεικηλίκτας, &amp;c.<a id="noteref_1960" name="noteref_1960" href="#note_1960"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1960</span></span></a> Even in the Laconian dialect, however,
the soft sound of ΣΔ is used instead of ΔΔ, as ἀγίσδεο, μελισδόμενος,
τράπεσδα in Alcman, and in the pretended apophthegm
of Lycurgus, ἂν πτωχοὶ μένητε καὶ μὴ μέσδω (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>
μείζω) ἅτερος θατέρω ἐράῃ κτῆμεν.<a id="noteref_1961" name="noteref_1961" href="#note_1961"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1961</span></span></a> It would however be erroneous
to suppose, with regard to the mode in which this
transition was effected, that the sound of Ζ, when already
formed, passed into ΔΔ or ΣΔ. The ancient dialect appears
to have had a separate Δ, pronounced with a peculiar
compression of the mouth; the Dorians in several cases,
agreeing with the Ionians, added the Σ, and formed either
Ζ, where the sounds were more combined, or ΣΔ. In
other cases the Dorians merely gave additional force to the
Δ. With the Æolians there was scarce any distinction between
the harsh and the common Δ, as in Δεὺς for Ζεὺς,
δυγὸς for ζυγὸς &amp;c.; in the same manner Ζεὺς in the Latin
became <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Deus</span></span>,
ῥίζα <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">radix</span></em>,
ὄζω <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">odor</span></em>,<a id="noteref_1962" name="noteref_1962" href="#note_1962"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1962</span></span></a> and hence the long Ζ
was wanting in that language; but the peculiarity of the
original sounds of this consonant is evident from the circumstance
that the Latins substituted for it I; for example
in <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">jugum</span></span> from ζυγὸς,
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">major</span></span> from μείζων, &amp;c.; in like manner
the Æolic dialect interchanged δια and ζα, καρζὰ, καρδία.<a id="noteref_1963" name="noteref_1963" href="#note_1963"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1963</span></span></a>
The change of the last letters of verbs ending in -σσω
into -ζω in the Tarentine dialect, instead of ττω like the
other Dorians, as ἀνάζω for ἀνάσσω, is quite peculiar to that
town.<a id="noteref_1964" name="noteref_1964" href="#note_1964"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1964</span></span></a>

6. Another mode of avoiding the sound of Σ was to omit
it altogether. This suppression was made at an early date
in the third person plural, which consequently retained a
nearer resemblance to the original form in the Doric than
in the Ionico-Attic dialect, in which the preservation of Σ
soon caused the ΝΤ to be dropped. Examples of this, as
πεινῶντι, ἀποδίδωντι, κεχάναντι, αἰνέοντι
(<span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">bhavanti</span></span>, in Sanscrit,
corresponding to the ancient high German
<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">ant</span></span>; the Bœotians
wrote -ωνθι, -ανθι) are found in all the Doric inscriptions;
yet Alcman uses the termination -ουσι as well as the
ancient form. Sometimes this elision of σ lengthened the
preceding vowel, as in Πηρεφονεία Lacon. for Περσεφονεία,
according to Hesychius, with which we may compare πῆριξ
for πέρδιξ in the Cretan dialect (ibid.); also πρειγεύτας, πρείγιστος,
πρειγηία in Cretan inscriptions for πρεσβεύτης, &amp;c.;
the Argives also used Γ for Β in πέργεις. (See Hesychius.)
Concerning the omission of Σ before Φ, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span>, φὶν for σφὶν,
in the Laconic dialect, see Koen p. 254.; the Syracusans
changed the place of the Σ, and converted ΣΦΙΝ into ΦΣΙΝ,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> ψίν. This aversion to Σ also appeared in the substitution
of the aspirate for this consonant, in which change the pure
Doric dialect is directly at variance with the Latin, in which the
aspirate was often replaced by Σ, for example, ἅλς,
<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">sal</span></span>, ἡμι, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">semi</span></span>,
ὕλϜη, sylva,<a id="noteref_1965" name="noteref_1965" href="#note_1965"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1965</span></span></a> &amp;c. The Laconians, on the other hand, used
μῶἁ, instead of μῶσα, and on the same principle μωἱκὰ,
<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">music</span></span>, as also in the participles κλεῶἁ, ἐκλιπῶἁ,
&amp;c, to which we may add ὅρμαὁν for ὅρμησον, as in Aristophanes;
also ποιῆἁς, πᾶἁ, βίὡρ for ἵσως,<a id="noteref_1966" name="noteref_1966" href="#note_1966"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1966</span></span></a> βουὅα for βουσόα;<a id="noteref_1967" name="noteref_1967" href="#note_1967"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1967</span></span></a> the
same usage also prevailed among the Argives, as we learn
from Dercyllus, among the Eretrians, who borrowed it from
the Eleans, and also among the Pamphylians; with whom
several Argive and Rhodian peculiarities of dialect appear
to have been preserved.<a id="noteref_1968" name="noteref_1968" href="#note_1968"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1968</span></span></a> Lastly, with this aversion to Σ is
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page429">[pg 429]</span><a name="Pg429" id="Pg429" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
connected the rhotacismus, which we have already observed
in the Spartan and Elean dialect, and of which the interpreters
of the decree against
Timotheus,<a id="noteref_1969" name="noteref_1969" href="#note_1969"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1969</span></span></a> particularly Casaubon,
have collected many examples. Of these I will
only cite ἐπιγελαστὴρ, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the mocker</span></em>; καλλίαρ,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">an ape</span></em> (Hesych.
in vv. comp. Boeckh Exp. Pind. Pyth. II. p. 251); κιλλακτὴρ,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">an ass-driver</span></em> (Pollux VII. 13. 56.); σάριρ, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a palm-branch</span></em>
(Hesych.); τίρ, τίς, (ib. and in the Elean Rhetra),
παλαιὸρ (Aristoph. Lys. 988.), σιὸρ θεὸς, πὸρ ποῦς, νέκυρ νέκυς,
βόμβυρ <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a kind of flute</span></em> (Hesych. in vv.). Whether in the
oblique cases Σ could always be changed into Ρ is uncertain,
since, besides the Elean Rhetra, no genuine monument, and
only a few and obscure glosses, afford any information on
the point. However, ἀμ᾽ ἀρκᾶρ for ἀπ᾽ ἀρχᾶς (according to
Koen's conjecture ad Gregor. p. 283.) is an instance, as also
the Cretan τέορ for σοῦ (Hesych.), where the pronoun is declined,
as ἐμοῦς, ἐμέος, ἐμεῦς in Epicharmus.<a id="noteref_1970" name="noteref_1970" href="#note_1970"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1970</span></span></a> We may observe
that generally the Latin is in this respect very different
from the pure Doric; though it resembles it in some words.
Thus the Laconian ἀκτὴρ is the Latin
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">actor</span></span>,
and in <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gubernator</span></span>
we see the Doric form κυβερνατὴρ, and so in other
instances.<a id="noteref_1971" name="noteref_1971" href="#note_1971"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1971</span></span></a>

7. Notwithstanding this <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">fuga sibili</span></span>—this aversion
to the Σ—to which almost all the changes mentioned in the last
two sections may be traced—yet the Doric dialects always
retained in the first person plural the final Σ from the ancient
language (as is proved by the Latin
-<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">mus</span></span>);<a id="noteref_1972" name="noteref_1972" href="#note_1972"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1972</span></span></a> and Laconians,
Megarians, and Doric Sicilians said ἥκομες, ἀπορέομες,
&amp;c. It does not appear that in the Doric dialect any
original consonant passed into Σ, except Θ; and this change
probably arose from a desire to soften the harsh sound of
the aspirate. Instances of this Laconism in Alcman (Ἀσᾶναι,
ἔσηκε, σάλλεν, σαλασσομέδοισαν), in the Lysistrata (ἤνσε,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page430">[pg 430]</span><a name="Pg430" id="Pg430" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
ἔλση, σιγεῖν, μουσίδδειν, &amp;c.), and the grammarians (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span>
σὶνκασεύδει, κασαίρηὁν, for καθαίρησον, according to Koen, κασαρεύειν,
according to Valckenær) are well known, and particularly
σεῖος ἀνήρ; comp. Valckenær, p. 277, sqq. who has
treated this point with great ability. Also in Hesychius,
συμβουαδεῖ, ὑπερμαχεῖ (for συμβοηθεῖ) we should probably
write συμβουασεῖ (otherwise Hemsterhuis), and κασελατίσαι,
καθίσαι, ibid. is from ἕλλα, ἕλα, κάθεδρα, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">sella</span></span>; whence
ἑλατίζειν, καθελατίζειν, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">sedere facio</span></span>. In this respect
the colonists of Sparta at Tarentum did not follow the idiom of their
mother city; as they said θυλακίζειν, not συλακίζειν, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to
beg</span></em>:<a id="noteref_1973" name="noteref_1973" href="#note_1973"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1973</span></span></a> the Rhodians also retained the original Θ in ἐρυθίβη (Strabo
XIII. p. 613. Eustath. ad Il. α. 34.): in Cretan this change
only occurs in σεῖναι for θεῖναι in Hesychius, and in σίος in
the treaty of the Olontians: for Corinth may be cited Σίσυφος
for Θεόσοφος, according to Phavorinus, p. 403. Dindorf;
for Sicyon perhaps σειρὸν, θέριστρον, Hesych. and also στίαι
for θριαὶ, Schol. Apoll. R.h. II. 1172. That the Eleans
were acquainted with this variety has been shown above.

8. In general the Dorians had less inclination to aspirated
consonants than the other tribes of Greece, and therefore in
many respects their dialect remained nearer to the primitive
language. Thus the Lacedæmonians and Cretans said ἀμπὶ
for ἀμφὶ (Koen ad Greg. p. 344), the latter in the derivative
ἀμπέτιξ, the former in ἀμπέσαι, (above, p. <a href="#Pg332" class="tei tei-ref">332</a>, note f.
[Transcriber's Note: This is the footnote to <span class="tei tei-q">“orthography,”</span>

δίκελλα, Hesych. <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">utrinque aptata</span></span>, makes an exception.
So also the Thessalians called the river Ἀμφίρρυσος, Ἀμβίρρυσος
(Schol. Apoll. Rh. I. 51); and the same, according
to the general rule (vol. I. p. 3, note g.), must be Macedonian
and Latin. Some instances of Κ for Χ in the Cretan,
Laconian, and Sicilian dialect, see in Koen p. 340, sqq.;
Pindar's δέκεσθαι is probably also Doric, as well as in the
Heraclean Tables. According to Hesychius in εὔπλουτον,
the Dorians called the baskets in which the οὐλοχύται were
carried ὀλβακήια, where ὀλβὰ is οὐλὴ, and the termination
-κήια is probably formed from χέω, unless (as is probable)
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page431">[pg 431]</span><a name="Pg431" id="Pg431" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
we should correct -χήια here and in the word ὀλβάχιον,
where Deinolochus (the Sicilian) is quoted as authority.
(Compare Suidas in δερβιστήρ.) The aspirate by itself is
absent from the words ἀγέομαι,<a id="noteref_1974" name="noteref_1974" href="#note_1974"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1974</span></span></a> ἀγησίχορος and the names
Ἆγις, Ἀγήσανδρος, Ἀγησίπολις, and Ἀγησίλαος (Ion. Ἡγησίλεως);
originally perhaps all these names had the digamma,
as Βαγὸς, a general <span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">Lacon.</span></span> in Hesychius. The
aspirate was also neglected by the Lacedæmonians in the
pronoun ἀμὲς, ἀμῶν;<a id="noteref_1975" name="noteref_1975" href="#note_1975"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1975</span></span></a> as well as
by the Cretans, as is evident from the words ΠΟΡΤΑΜΕ, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> πορτὶ
ἀμὲ, in an inscription
(Chishull, p. 115. 10.), and by the Dorians. In the
word ἰάλλω likewise the lene breathing is Doric, as is shown
by ἀπιάλλειν in Thucyd. V. 77: and the Syracusan name
Ἐπιάλης (Demetrius περὶ Ἑρμηνείας, § 157. Eustath. ad Il.
ε᾽. p. 571. Rom.). On the other hand the digamma was
retained nearly as much among the Lacedæmonians and
other Dorians, as by most of the Æolians; among the Dorians,
however, it generally assumed the form of Β. See
Etymol. M. p. 308. 26. Gudian. p. 104. 12. I will only
cite a few examples. The Laconian word for <span class="tei tei-q">“splendour”</span>
was βέλα, Ϝέλα (Hesychius), <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> ἕλη, whence by the prefix
α, signifying an union or number, the word ἀβελιος (ΑϜΕΛΙΟΣ)
was formed, literally <span class="tei tei-q">“a collection or mass of brightness;”</span>
the Cretan and Pamphylian name for the sun
(Hesychius; compare Hemsterhuis ad Hesych. in θάβακον).<a id="noteref_1976" name="noteref_1976" href="#note_1976"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1976</span></span></a>
The Greek or Æolic word for the <span class="tei tei-q">“ear”</span> was αὖας,
in Latin <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">auris</span></span>, in
Doric ὦϜας (like καππώτας for καταπαύτης),
whence the Laconian word ἐξωβάδια (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> ἐξωϜάτια)
ἐνώτια, in Hesychius. In ὠατωθήσω, ἀκούσομαι, Doric according
to Photius, the digamma is lost, as well as in the
Tarentine contraction ἆτα, Hesychius. From the root
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page432">[pg 432]</span><a name="Pg432" id="Pg432" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
ΔΑΙϜΩ, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">to burn</span></span>, are derived the Laconian forms δάβει,
καύεται (vulg. κάθηται, otherwise Hemsterhuis), ἐκδάβη,
ἐκαύθε; δάβελος, δαλὸς in Hesychius; also τῦρ δάϜιον in Alcman,
fragm. 76. ed. Welcker. In Crete also we find the
forms ἀβηδὼν for ἀηδὼν, βαλικιώτης for ἡλικιώτης, βαίκα for
αἴκα or ἐὰν (Hesychius and Koen ad Greg. p. 251.); according
to the same grammarian the Cretans called their
shields λαῖβαι, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">lævæ</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the left</span></span>; thus by a reverse analogy
the Greeks said παρ᾽ ἀσπίδα for <span class="tei tei-q">“to the left.”</span> The
Laconian word for <span class="tei tei-q">“the dawn,”</span> was ΑϜΩΣ (also retained
in μιργάβωρ, λυκόφως, Hesych. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> μισγ-άϜως), among the
other Greeks ΗΩΣ: and as from the latter form the name
of the east-wind εὖρος was derived (answering to ζέφυρος, ὃς
ἐκ ζόφου πνεῖ), so from the Doric ἄϜως came the word αὖρα,
which had in this dialect the peculiar sense of <span class="tei tei-q">“morning;”</span>
hence ἐναύρω πρωῒ, Κρῆτες, and ἀβὼ, Λάκωνες, Hesychius.
At Argos the digamma occurs in ὤβεα for ᾠὰ (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">ova</span></span>) Hesych.;
at Hermione a double digamma in βεῦδος for ἕδος, ἄγαλμα,
Etymol. M. p. 195. 52.; at Syracuse in ἔβασον for ἔασον,
which was also a Laconian form, ib. p. 308. 26. Hesych.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
9. If we except the changes of the vowels, semivowels,
and aspirates, there are not many others peculiar to the
Doric dialect, since the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">mediæ</span></span>
and <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">tenues</span></span> were seldom inverted,
and not often letters which are not cognate. It is
worthy of remark that the Dorians frequently changed both
Β and Γ into Δ, the former in δέλτον, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">good</span></span>, compared with
βέλτιον, and ὀδελὸς for ὀβελός;<a id="noteref_1977" name="noteref_1977" href="#note_1977"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1977</span></span></a> the latter in δᾶ for γᾶ, δένος
for γένος, δίφουρα for γέφυρα in Laconian, δεῦκος for γλυκὺς
in Ætolian, which likewise was preserved in the Latin
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">dulcis</span></span>.<a id="noteref_1978" name="noteref_1978" href="#note_1978"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1978</span></span></a>
I should also remark that πέδα for μετὰ is pure Doric,
as is proved by Alcman ap. Athen. X. p. 416 A. the Laconian
word πέδευρα, ὕτερον, in Hesychius, πεδάϜοικοι for
μέτοικοι in an Argive inscription (Boeckh. No. 14.), and the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page433">[pg 433]</span><a name="Pg433" id="Pg433" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Corcyræan inscription in Mustoxidi, tom. II. p. 70. (as it
appears.)
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Doric dialect is also marked by a strong tendency to
the omission of letters both in composition and flexion. In
composition the prepositions κατὰ, ἀνὰ, ποτὶ become monosyllables
by the suppression of the last vowel: and even
with the first syllable short in καβαίνων, Alcman. fragm. 34.
κάπετον, Pindar. Olymp. VIII. 48. compare Hesychius in
κάβλημα and κάβασι. The Venus ἀμβολογήρα of Sparta
(Pausan. III. 18. 1.) has been already explained from ἀναβάλλειν
τὸ γῆρας, as also Ζεὺς καππώτας (ib. III. 22. 1.) as
Ζεὺς καταπαύτης. Κάκκη, κάθευδε, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Laconice</span></span> in Hesychius,
shortened by apocope from κάκκησι, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> κατάκειθι, as ἔμβη
for ἔμβησι in Aristoph. Lys. 1303. In conjugation the Dorians
frequently shortened the ancient longer forms by apocope,
and not, like the other cases, by contraction; as in the
infinitives δόμεν for δόμεμαι, εἶμεν or ἦμεν for ἤμμενκι, &amp;c. the
uncontracted form being seldom used, as ἤμεναι Aristoph.
Ach. 775., ἀλεξέμεναι, Thucyd. V. 77., or the contracted, as
σκιρωθῆναι in Sophron. ap. Etym. M. p. 717, ext. and in
Alcman. fragm. 23, Welcker is probably right in changing
χαρῆθαι into χαρῆναι. Also the shortened third persons of
the aorists, διέγνον in the Heraclean Tables, ἔδον (Corp. Inscript.
No. 1511.), ἀνέθεν (ib. No. 29.), διελέγεν in the decree
of the Oaxians, διελέγην in that of the Istronians; as well as
the infinitives in εν and the second persons in ες, for ειν and
εις, and many other similar changes. The forms εἴμειν, γεγόνειν
are not merely Agrigentine; the former also occurs in
an inscription (probably of Rhodes) in Chandler, p. 14.
No. 38: the Sicilian adverbs τῶ, τουτῶ (τουτῶ θάμεθα Sophron.
fragm. 34. Mus. Crit. vol. II. p. 347.) for πόθεν, τουτόθεν,
also come under this head. Ammonius adds πῦς for
πόσε and ποῖ for πόθε.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
10. With regard to the differences of syntax, we may
remark that the article was much used by the Dorians; as
is evident from several passages in the Spartan choruses in
the Lysistrata of Aristophanes.<a id="noteref_1979" name="noteref_1979" href="#note_1979"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1979</span></span></a> It may be also observed
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page434">[pg 434]</span><a name="Pg434" id="Pg434" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that the article occurs very frequently in all the early monuments
of Doric nations;<a id="noteref_1980" name="noteref_1980" href="#note_1980"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1980</span></span></a> and that in the Doric poetry,
particularly of Alcman, it was first introduced into the literature
of Greece: the earlier language having been quite
destitute of it. Hence perhaps it may be inferred that it
was the Dorians who introduced the general use of the
article; which would afford some idea of the changes which
the Greek language experienced in consequence of the revolution
caused by the Doric invasion.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Every dialect has peculiar words; but it is remarkable
when these are radical forms, expressing very common
ideas, and when they are quite foreign to the other dialects
of the same language. This at least is true of the Laconian
word χάος, χάϊος, ἀχαῖος, <span class="tei tei-q">“good”</span> (Aristoph. Lys. 90,
1157. Hesychius in ἀχαία, where Heinsius would without
reason omit the α, Theocrit. VII. 4.), of κόος, <span class="tei tei-q">“large”</span>
(Etymol. M. p. 396. 29.), which words stand quite isolated
in the common language: also λῆν, <span class="tei tei-q">“to wish”</span> (Koen. p. 252.
Maittaire p. 278.), and μάω, <span class="tei tei-q">“I think,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“I seek,”</span> are pure
Doric forms; the latter a Laconian and Sicilian word, see
Toup Emend, in Suid. vol. I. p. 462. Meineke Euphorion.
p. 162.<a id="noteref_1981" name="noteref_1981" href="#note_1981"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1981</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
11. As yet we have considered the Doric dialect in general,
as spoken by the whole race, only marking out the
Laconian as its purest variety; we will now annex a brief
list of those shades of difference which can be perceived in
the language of the several states. The broad peculiarities
of the Doric dialect of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Laconia</span></em> are partly known from the
remains of Alcman (who however avoided in his poetry
such harsh forms as μῶἁ for μῶσα, λιπῶἁ for λιπῶσα or
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page435">[pg 435]</span><a name="Pg435" id="Pg435" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
λιποῖσα, and never uses Σ for Ρ, &amp;c.); and more fully from
the Spartans in the Lysistrata. On comparing these with
the Spartan and Argive treaty in Thucydides V. 77., there
is indeed a general agreement; yet in this document the
contractions ἀναιροῦντας, πεντηκονταέτη, δοκῇ, πόλει (but πολίεσι
and αὐτοπόλιες), also ἐρίζοι and δικάζεσθαι, together with ως
in the accusative of the substantives, but ους of the adjectives,
can hardly be considered as pure Doric; nor is
there any instance of the change of Σ into the aspirate, and
Σ for Θ only in the word σιῶ. With regard to the indiscriminate
use of Ω and ΟΥ our copies of Thucydides are not
much authority: for these two sounds were not distinguished
in the writing of the time, being both expressed by
Ο; and it is probable that some forms have been modified
either by Thucydides or his copyists, or both. On the
whole, however, it is probable that the popular dialect of
Peloponnesus, which is preserved in all its harshness in
the famous treaty of the Eleans, was about the time of the
Peloponnesian war softened down in public documents
and treaties. Thus in a Lacedæmonian inscription of later
date, we still find the ancient forms στατερας, αιγιναιος, αργυριο,
Ϝικατι, δαρικος οκτακατιος, from a restoration, but also
χιλιους δαρ[ικους], Corp. Inscript. No. 1511. In the Spartan
decree preserved by Plutarch in his Life of Lysander c. 14.,
we should probably write, ταῦτα ΚΑ δρῶντες τὰν εἰράναν
ἔχοιτε, ἃ χρὴ ΔΟΝΤΕΣ καὶ τὼς φυγάδας ἀνέντες. περὶ τᾶν
ναῶν τῶ πλήθεος ὁκοῖόν τι ΚΑΤΗΝΕΙ δοκέοι, ταῦτα ποιέετε, as
has been partly emended by Haitinger Act. Monac. vol. III.
p. 311. In the time of Pyrrhus much of the ancient peculiarity
of the dialect was still in existence, although in the
following saying all the forms are not those of the ancient
Laconian language, αἂ μὲν ἔσσι τύ γε θεὸς, οὐδὲν μὴ πάθωμεν,
οὐ γὰρ, ἀδικεῦμεν; αἂ δ᾽ ἄνθρωπος, ἔσεται καὶ τεῦ κάρρων ἄλλος,
Plutarch. Pyrrh. 26. The remains of it in the decrees of
the Eleutherolacones and Spartans in the time of the emperors
are less considerable. That the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Messenians</span></em> retained
the ancient idiom, from ancient recollections, or perhaps from
affectation, was remarked above, p. <a href="#Pg414" class="tei tei-ref">414</a>, note 
c.
[Transcriber's Note: This is the footnote to <span class="tei tei-q">“Messenians of Sicily,”</span>
starting <span class="tei tei-q">“The coins.”</span>] The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Argive</span></em>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page436">[pg 436]</span><a name="Pg436" id="Pg436" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
dialect has been more than once observed to agree with the
Cretan, a correspondence which may be even traced in unimportant
particulars; thus the name of the Argive βαλλαχράδαι
(above, p. <a href="#Pg355" class="tei tei-ref">355</a>. note n
[Transcriber's Note: There is no such footnote on that page.]), was derived from ἀχρὰς,
which Hermonax ap. Schol. Nicand. Ther. 512. calls a Cretan,
and Hesychius a Laconian word. The grammarians
likewise particularly remark that in the Argive dialect Ι was
frequently changed into Ν, as in μέντον for μέντοι (Argive
and Cretan, Maittaire p. 255), αἰὲν, ἔννατος (Etymol. M.
p. 402, 2.) φαεννὸς (see Boeckh Not. crit. ad Pind. Olymp. I.
6.); the Sicilians in many cases made the contrary change—the
Rhegini, however, the same as the Argives (Etymol. M.
p. 135, 45. Gud. 73, 44.); which peculiarity they had evidently
borrowed from the Messenians. Dercyllus wrote in
the ancient Argive dialect; see Etymol. M. p. 391, 20.
above, p. <a href="#Pg385" class="tei tei-ref">385</a>, note c.
[Transcriber's Note: This is the footnote to <span class="tei tei-q">“Ionians and Athenians,”</span>
starting <span class="tei tei-q">“This is only true.”</span>] The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Cretan</span></em> has a singularity which
does not appear to have been observed in any other dialect
of Greece, viz. of changing λ before a consonant and after ε
or α into υ (analogous to the French forms
<span lang="fr" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">aumóne</span></span>,
<span lang="fr" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">haubergeon</span></span>,
&amp;c. from the German <span lang="de" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="de"><span style="font-style: italic">Almosen</span></span>,
<span lang="de" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="de"><span style="font-style: italic">Halsberge</span></span>, &amp;c.);
thus αὖσος for ἄλσος, αὖμα for ἅλμα, likewise αὐκυόνα, αὔκαν;
θεύγεσθαι and εὐθεῖν for θέλγεσθαι and ἐλθεῖν, according to Hesychius,
Koen. p. 354. The Ætolian word δεῦκος also shows
the same formation, as it comes from the ancient root δέλκυς,
<span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">dulcis</span></span>. There is an analogous change in the
Cretan forms Πραῖσος from Πρῖανσος, and γεροίταν, πάππον (Hesych.)
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> for γέροντας from γέρων, and directly the reverse of that
observed above in the termination of the participles τιθὲνς, &amp;c.
where the Cretans retained the ancient form τιθὲνς, which
other Greeks softened into τιθεὶς, &amp;c. The Cretan βέντιον for
βέλτιον is paralleled by the Sicilian forms ἦνθον and φίντατος.
The words peculiar to the Cretan town Polyrrhenia,
such as σέρτης <span class="tei tei-q">“a crane,”</span> ἅμαλλα <span class="tei tei-q">“a partridge,”</span> κόμβα <span class="tei tei-q">“a
crow,”</span> (see also Hesychius in κάρα and λάττα) are probably
remains of an ancient Cydonian language, having no
affinity with the Greek. See Hoeck's Kreta, vol. I. p. 146,
note b. In the Cretan inscriptions of the beginning of the
second century before Christ, the ancient dialect is still preserved
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page437">[pg 437]</span><a name="Pg437" id="Pg437" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in some words, but not regularly and constantly;
peculiarities such as αὖσος no longer appear: and if they
were found in a writer named Cypselas, he must have been
of a much earlier date (Joann. Gramm. ad calc. H. Steph.
Thes. Gr. p. 13.). Some peculiarities of the Doric dialect
of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Corinth</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Sicyon</span></em> have been noticed above; in general,
however, we know little of these dialects; but of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Megarian</span></em>
we are better informed by means of the Acharneans
of Aristophanes, and this probably gives a tolerably correct
notion of the Doric of Peloponnesus, except Sparta.
The Dryopians of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Hermione</span></em> also spoke Doric; at least an
Hermionean inscription contains such Dorisms as ἐπιδαμῶντι,
ποττὰν πόλιν, τοὺς δὲ λαΐναν δόμεν στάλαν, Boeckh No. 1193.
and see others cited vol. I. p. 399, note y. The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Rhodians</span></em>
still spoke Doric in the time of Tiberius (Sueton. Tiber.
56.), and indeed, as Aristides de Conc. boasts, in great
purity (see Meurs. Rhod. II. 3.). Inscriptions of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Cos</span></em> (in
Spon), <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Calymna</span></em> (Chandler. Inscript. p. 21. No. 58.), <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Astypalæa</span></em>,
and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Anaphæ</span></em> (in Villoison's papers) are written in a
Doric style, common in such monuments. The same was
also adopted by the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Æginetans</span></em> after their re-establishment;
see the inscription in Æginetica, p. 136, and the remarks
on it in p. 160. Among the inscriptions of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Corcyra</span></em>, collected
by Mustoxidi, a series might be arranged according
to the greater and less traces of the Doric dialect; the large
one in Boeckh's Staatshaushaltung, vol. II. p. 400. contains
several peculiarities, as, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span> the imperative δόντω. In a
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Theræan</span></em> inscription, containing the will of a certain Epicteta
(Boeckh, No. 2448.), several pure Dorisms occur, as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span>
the accusative plural in ος, the infinitives ἀγαγὲν, θύεν,
(Eustathius ad Od. τ᾽. p. 706. 49. quotes λέγες for λέγεις as
Theræan); at the same time several peculiar forms, such as
ἐστάκεια, συναγαγόχεια; and upon the whole there is little
archaic in the language. But the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Byzantine</span></em> dialect was in
the time of Philip, as we know from the decree in Demosthenes,
rich in Dorisms: not so many occur in the more
recent inscription in Chandler Inscript. App. p. 95. No. 10.
How much of the language of the surrounding nations had
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page438">[pg 438]</span><a name="Pg438" id="Pg438" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
been introduced into the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Cyrenæan</span></em> dialect cannot be determined:
according to Hesychius βρίκος was the Cyrenæan
word for <span class="tei tei-q">“ass;”</span> which resembles the Spanish word

<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">both</span></em> probably were derived from Africans. All that we
know of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Tarentine</span></em> dialect appears to have been taken
from the Phlyaces of Rhinthon, who lived in the time of
Ptolemy the First; although very different from the ancient
Laconian dialect, it has many peculiarities:<a id="noteref_1982" name="noteref_1982" href="#note_1982"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1982</span></span></a> but besides the
vulgar language of Tarentum there was also spoken a
polished (Attic) dialect, which was alone used in public
transactions. See Dionys. Hal. Exc. p. 2239. ed. Reiske.
With regard to the exchange of words with the neighbouring
Italian nations (above, p. <a href="#Pg413" class="tei tei-ref">413</a>, note z
[Transcriber's Note: This is the footnote to <span class="tei tei-q">“the Siculians,”</span>
starting <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">E.g.</span></span> besides.”</span>]), it is sometimes
doubtful which party borrowed from the other. Thus
Alcman uses πόλτος for <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">puls</span></span>; are we to suppose that this
word was so early brought over from Italy? Κάρκαρον is
used for <span class="tei tei-q">“prison”</span> by Sophron, for <span class="tei tei-q">“stall”</span> by Rhinthon: it
is the same word as the Latin <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">carcer</span></span>; but
possibly <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">both</span></em> are
derived from the Laconian word γέργυρα in Alcman. That
the Italian <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Heracleans</span></em> should have preserved the ancient
language and writing to the fifth century after the building
of Rome so faithfully as the famous Heraclean Tables
show us, is very remarkable. At <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Syracuse</span></em> the dialect was
nearly the same as that in which Epicharmus and Sophron
wrote: the laws of Diocles too were probably drawn up in
this dialect, but the circumstance of their requiring an interpreter
in the time of Timoleon is a proof of the rapid preponderance
of the Attic language in this city (<a href="#Book_III_Chapter_IX_Section_7" class="tei tei-ref">B.
III. ch. 9. § 7</a>.). The language of Sophron is also nearer to the common
dialect, and less strictly Doric than that spoken in
Peloponnesus in his time; <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span>, he always says τοὺς and not
τώς. On the spreading of the Doric dialect in Sicily see
Castelli Proleg. p. 25. We have not as yet touched on the
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Delphic</span></em> dialect, the strong Doric character of which is proved
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page439">[pg 439]</span><a name="Pg439" id="Pg439" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
by an inscription (Boeckh No. 1690.) in which ὀδελοὶ and
τέτορες occur, and still more, as I believe, by a monument of
Olymp. 100. 1, which has futures such as ὀρκεξέω &amp;c., the
infinitives ἀπογράψεν, φέρεν, and θύεν, αἴκα for ἐὰν, πάντεσσι,
ἱερομναμόνεσσι, διακάτιοι, ἐπικοσμήσωντι, ἐν for ἐς
<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">adverbialiter</span></span>,
καττὰν, ἐνιαύτιος, πέμπωντι, ποττὸν (Boeckh No. 1688.).
Besides this, all the prose oracles given at Delphi were
doubtless written in Doric; as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span> that in Demosth. in
Mid. p. 531, and in Macart. p. 1072, that in Thuc. V. 16.
(—ἀργυρέᾳ εὐλάκᾳ εὐλάξειν, is, according to the scholiast, a
Laconian expression), and the oracle quoted in vol. I. p. 199.
note p, ποῖ τὺ λαβὼν καὶ ποῖ τὺ καθίξων καὶ ποῖ τὺ οἴκησιν (here
the sense requires ἀσφαλέως ἕξεις, ἐρωτᾷς, κελεύω...) ἁλιέα
τε κεκλῆσθαι, which, however, was probably written in hexameters,
since the epic oracles sometimes show traces of
Dorisms (Herod. IV. 155, 157; compare that given to
the Lacedæmonians, ἁ φιλοχρηματία &amp;c.). Plutarch (Pyth.
Orac. 24. p. 289.) quotes from ancient oracles the expression
πυρίκαοι (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> πυρκέοι, as the Delphians themselves were
called, vol. I. p. 254. note b), ὀρεάνας for
ἄνδρας,<a id="noteref_1983" name="noteref_1983" href="#note_1983"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1983</span></span></a> ὀρεμπότας for
ποτάμους; likewise κραταίπους (Schol. Pind. Olymp. XIII.
114.) is probably from an oracle: from the Dorisms of the
vulgar dialect we have Γυγάδας for the treasure of Gyges,
Herod. I. 14, a half-adjective form in -ας, which occurs
frequently in Doric, and ἅρμα for ἀρμὴ, <span class="tei tei-q">“love,”</span> Plutarch
Amator, 23. The name of the month Βύσιος (ap. Plutarch
Quæst. Gr. 9. and in Delphian inscriptions) was derived
by some from Φύσιος, as being a spring-month; it is, however,
far more probable that this sacred oracular month received
its name from Pytho, as Πύθιος. In that case the
change of θ into σ corresponds with the Laconian dialect;
but that of π into β is peculiar to the Delphians, among
whom, according to Plutarch, it also occurred in βικρὸς for
πικρὸς, and other words. A newly discovered honorary
decree of Delphi (Ross, Inscript. Græc. ined. Fasc. I. No.
57.) points to a closer affinity of the Delphian and Ætolian
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page440">[pg 440]</span><a name="Pg440" id="Pg440" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
dialects. We find in it the datives ἀγώνοις, ἐντυγχανόντοις,
and therefore the same metaplasm of declination as among
the Ætolians, to whom the grammarians attribute such
forms as γερόντοις, παθημάτοις. The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Phoceans</span></em> appear from
the inscriptions to have spoken an Æolic dialect, nearly
akin to the Doric. A remarkable peculiarity, which occurs
in inscriptions both of Steiris and Daulis, in the territory
of the Phoceans, is that the radical vowel of τίθημι and
ἵημι remains unlengthened in the active and passive perfect;
as in ἀνατεθέκαντι, ἀνατεθεμένους, ἀφεμένα for ἀνατεθείνασι,
ἀνατεθειμένους, ἀφειμένη.

2. In reckoning from the migration of the Heraclidæ downwards,
we follow the Alexandrine chronology, of which it
should be observed, that our materials only enable us to restore
it to its original state, not to examine its correctness.
That it was chiefly founded upon original records and monuments
preserved in Peloponnesus, which gave even the years
of the kings, has been shown above, b. I. ch. 7. § 3. The
dates which Syncellus has preserved from Eusebius, Eusebius
from Diodorus, and Diodorus from Apollodorus, could
not have been calculated merely by generations; and
Larcher's criticism and rejection of the Alexandrine Chronologists
may perhaps be found as groundless as they are
presumptuous.

P. 19. l. 18. In the explanation of Melia, the ash has been confounded
with the alder. It seems that the ash, which probably
reached a greater height than any other tree in Greece, is used in
this genealogy, as in Hesiod Theog. 187, for the force of vegetation
generally.

P. 80. l. 11. It may be objected that the countries in which
commerce and manufactures have flourished most, have not possessed
mines of the precious metals. This remark is true of
modern Europe; but in Greece the copper of Chalcis appears to
be connected with the Chalcidean trade and colonies, and the gold
of Thasos with the maritime pursuits of the Thasians and their large
navy before the time of Cimon. The silver of Laurion likewise
contributed to the industry and foreign commerce of Attica. The
prosperity of the maritime cities of Asia Minor was at least assisted
by the gold mines in Lydia; as may be seen in the very ancient
golden staters (partly made of electron, which according to Soph.
Ant. 1025 came from Sardis) of Phocæa, Lampsacus, Clazomenæ,
&amp;c.

P. 384. note c add—The identification of Artemis with the moon
is earlier than that of Apollo with the sun (B. II. ch. 5. § 5.)
The former occurs not only in Æschyl. Xant. fr. 158. ed. Dindorf,
but is also manifest in the worship of the Munychian and
Brauronian Artemis. The name Αἰθοπία designates her shining
countenance or orb; and a cake surrounded with lights, called for
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page480">[pg 480]</span><a name="Pg480" id="Pg480" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that reason ἀμφιφῶν or ἀμφιφῶς, was offered to the goddess on the
16th of Munychion, because the moon was full on that day. See

III. p. 213. Poets, such as
Thaletas, Terpander, Nymphæus

in the ἀγλαὸν ἄστυ, v.

Pherecydes and Anaximander
and Anacharsis the Scythian,
were willingly admitted; other
classes of persons were excluded.
Thus there were regulations
concerning persons, and
the time of admitting foreigners:
and hence the earlier
writers, such as Thucydides,
Xenophon, and Aristotle, always
speak of ξενηλασίαι in the
plural number. (Compare Plut.
Inst. Lac. 20.) See also Plut.

It may be added that the numerous ξενίαι and προξενίαι, the
hospitable connexions of states
and individuals, served to alleviate
the harshness of the institution.
Thus the Lacedæmonians
were connected with the
Pisistratidæ (vol. I. p. 188,
note c), and with the family of
Callias (Xen. Symp. 8. 39);
Endius with Clinias, the father
of Alcibiades (Thuc. VIII. 6);
king Archidamus with Pericles
(ib. II. 13); Xenias the Elean
with king Agis, the son of
Archidamus, and the state
of Sparta. (Paus. III. 8. 2.)
See <a href="#Book_III_Chapter_XI_Section_6" class="tei tei-ref">B. III. ch. 6. § 7</a>, and
vol. I. p. 209, n. z. The exchange
of names, occasioned by προξενίαι,
might be made the subject
of a distinct investigation.
See the note last cited, and
Paus. III. 6. 41. Moreover the
Spartans sometimes gave freedom
from custom duties, and
the privilege of occupying a seat
of honour at the games at
Sparta, to strangers, even of

the Deceleans, according to

the battle, contrary to the calculation

the time immediately preceding
the Persian war, as is evident
not only from the word νεωστὶ,

that the Argives desired a thirty
years' peace, to enable the children
of the persons who had
been slain to arrive at manhood.

expression is not quite clear.
The notion of the Scholiast to
Thucydides, adopted by Larcher,
that each king had only one
vote, though it had the force of
two, is ridiculous. The γερουσία
was ἰσόψηφος τὰ μέγιστα with
the kings, according to Plat.

The first πρῶτον refers
to the office of the ephor eponymus;
and hence appears to
have originated the mistake
which is contained in the words

that Chilon first introduced the

further proves, p. 606, that the

are called in the inscriptions

have been strictly applicable to

despised the irregular proceedings
of the people, and therefore

the words ἵνα μετέχῃ again prove
their actual existence.—As to
the interpretation of the words
κοινὰ ποιοῦντες τὰ κτήματα ἐπὶ
τὴν χρῆσιν, it is known that at
Rome, when the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ager publicus</span></span>
was divided among the plebeians,
it was either given them by assignation
as absolute property
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">mancipium</span></span>,
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">dominium</span></span>), in
which case it ceased to be <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">publicus</span></span>;
or it was held by <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">possessiones</span></span>,
in early times by the
patricians, who only occupied it
with an usufructuary right, while
the land remained <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">publicus</span></span>, was
not marked out with limits, and
could be at any time reclaimed
by the state (See Niebuhr's
Roman History, vol. II. p. 363.
sqq. ed. 1. Eng. Transl. compare
vol. I. note 443. ed. 2.).
The occupation of the public
lands of Tarentum was probably
allowed to the poor on similar
conditions. As to the δίττας
ποιεῖν τὰς ἀρχὰς, Aristotle seems
to mean, that if, for example,
there had been two agoranomi,
four strategi, &amp;c. they then made
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">four</span></em> agoranomi, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">eight</span></em> strategi,

With regard to the story of

be remarked, that the suitors
could not have been deceived
as to whether they possessed
landed property or not; but
they thought that the father
had large personal property,

among them.—Lysander also
left male issue, as appears from
Paus. III. 6. 41. of whom one
was named Libys, in memory
of the proxenia of Lysander

which the νόμος would have

Pol. IV. 8., indeed says,

Lysist. 454. there were

evidently ΜΕΣΟΑΤΗΣ; of the

Neither can the four lochi of
the king be easily explained (cf.
Schol. Acharn. 1087); perhaps
it is only another expression for
the mora of the king (Xen. Rep.
Lac. 13. 6.). There were five
(or six) lochi in Sparta, according
to Aristotle, Photius in
λόχοι, Hesychius, and his commentators.
Xenophon Hell.

Inscript. No. 1050; where Orsippus
is stated to have regained
a part of the Megarian territory
which had been lost in
war, and to have first run in the
stadium at Olympia without a
girdle. Now Orsippus, according
to the certain testimony of
Julius Africanus, was victorious
in the stadium at Olympia in
the 15th Olympiad; and this
statement is confirmed by Eustathius
and Hesychius ubi
sup.; whereas the Etymologicum
M. and the Scholia vulg.
ad Il. ψ᾽. 683. place the victory
of Orsippus at Olymp. 32.
(652 B.C.); in which, according
to Africanus, Cratinus of
Megara was the conqueror. All
these apparently contradictory
statements have been reconciled
by Boeckh ib. p. 554 sq. as follows.
Orsippus, either accidentally,
or at least to appearance
accidentally, lost his girdle
when running in the stadium;
in training afterwards, Acanthus
the Lacedæmonian laid aside
his girdle altogether; and
thenceforth it became the established
practice at the games.

Accordingly, Praxiteles (Pliny,

a joint composition of Caryatides
and Thyades; and Pratinas
(Athen. X. p. 392.) wrote
a play called Δύμαιναι ἢ Καρυάτιδες,
the former of whom,
also called Δύσμαιναι, occur as
Bacchantes. The form Δύσμαιναι
is defended against Toup

says on the age of Homer, which
must be a misunderstanding). Apollodorus
is followed by Dionysius of
Halicarnassus and Solinus: see
Larcher, Chronologie d'Hérodote, p.
373. The calculation of Timæus
only differed by nine years, vol. I.
p. 131. note t, who is nearly followed
by Velleius Paterculus. The date of
Apollodorus can now be completely
restored from the Armenian Eusebius
p. 166; from which we see that,
according to Apollodorus, the first
Olympiad coincided with the 10th
year of Alcamenes. The Canons of
Eusebius place the first Olympiad at
the 37th and last year of Alcamenes;
an error which appears to have arisen
from Eusebius having taken the first
year of Eurysthenes as identical with
the epoch of the return of the Heraclidæ.
Apollodorus however appears
to have allowed thirty years
for the minority of the brothers, see
vol. II. p. <a href="#Pg090" class="tei tei-ref">90</a>. note u.
[Transcriber's Note: This is the footnote to <span class="tei tei-q">“rights by law,”</span>
starting <span class="tei tei-q">“Plut. Lyc. 25.”</span>] And he seems
not to have reckoned the time from
the entrance of the Heraclidæ into
Sparta until the birth of the brothers,
which Herod. VII. 52. calls χρόνον οὐ
πολλόν. Now the canons have 324
years from the return of the Heraclidæ
to Olymp. 1. (916 to 1240);
if from this we deduct 26 years for
Alcamenes, in whose 37th year the
first Olympiad falls, according to the
calculation of the canons, and add
30 years for the minority, we obtain
328, the number of Apollodorus.
Apollodorus apparently took the 10
years of Alcamenes before Olymp. 1.
as complete; whereas Eratosthenes
probably placed Olymp. 1. at the
beginning of this 10th year; hence
the difference of 327 and 328 years.

the foundation of Syracuse in

Lamis the Megarian founded Trotilus
and Thapsus in the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">same</span></em> year,
and went from Thapsus to Megara.
Why then, it must be asked, does
not Thucydides (VI. 4.) say that
Lamis went to the Chalcideans at
Leontini ὀλίγῳ ὕστερον that he had
founded Trotilus, as he states that
he remained ὀλίγον χρόνον at Leontini,
if Thucydides meant that all these
events should be understood to follow
in so very rapid a succession?
At the same time the author acknowledges
that though the arguments
of Clinton, Fast. Hell. vol. II
p. 265. ed. 2, for the founding of
Syracuse in Olymp. 11. 4. have not
convinced him, they have shaken his
former conviction: and he adds the
following remark in favour of that
opposite opinion. If Syracuse was
founded in Olymp. 5. 3., the founding
of Camarina must be placed in
Olymp. 39. 2. (Thuc. VI. 5.) Camarina,
according to Scymnus v. 293,
was destroyed forty-six years afterwards,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> in Olymp. 50. 4. Now
it appears from the authentic catalogues
of the conquerors at the
Olympic games, that Parmenides of
Camarina was victorious in the stadium
in Olymp. 63. Camarina had
not at that time been rebuilt; he
could therefore only have been so
called from his native place; which
would (according to the assumed
dates) have been then destroyed
forty-nine years. It must, however,
have been uncommon for men of
fifty to be victorious in running. If,
however, we place the foundation of
Camarina in Olymp. 45. 1, and the
destruction in Olymp. 56 (with the
Schol. Pind. Ol. V. 16.), the whole
receives a greater degree of probability.

I. The three passages of
Pausanias, V. 63. V. 10. 2. VI. 22.
2. on the ἀνάστασις of the Pisans,
evidently refer to the same event;
and consequently the second of them
should be interpreted thus: <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the
statue of Jupiter is made from the
plunder gained at the time when the
Eleans overcame Pisa</span></span>.”</span> This is

Ueber den Tempel des Olympischen
Jupiters, p. 6. Krueger de Xenoph.
Vita. II. In Strabo VIII. p. 355, C.
the ἱσχάτη κατάλυσις τῶν Μεσσηνίων
cannot be the war of Olymp. 81; since
the Pisans could neither have had the
management of the games at that
time, nor any Nestoridæ been in existence
at Pylos. But he must mean
the subjugation of Messenia after the
30th Olympiad, after which time the
Lacedæmonians perhaps assisted the
Eleans in gradually weakening Pisa,
until in the 50th Olympiad it became
completely subject. A more precise
date for the distinction of Pisa may
be gathered from the strange statement
of the catalogue of the Olympiad
in Eusebius according to Africanus,
that the Pisans celebrated the
30th and the 22 following Olympiads
(vid. ad Ol. 30); if we understand
it to mean that the Pisans had a share
in the celebration of the Olympiads
until their destruction. According
to this, Pisa was destroyed in Olymp.

            support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number
            of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in
            machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment
            including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are
            particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the
            IRS.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
            charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
            States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
            considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
            with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where
            we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
            DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
            visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate" class="tei tei-xref">http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate</a></p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
            have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
            against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
            approach us with offers to donate.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
            any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
            outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods and
            addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including
            checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please

            originator of the Project Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that
            could be freely shared with anyone. For thirty years, he produced and
            distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer
            support.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of
            which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright
            notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in
            compliance with any particular paper edition.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
            eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
            compressed (zipped), HTML and others.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Corrected <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">editions</span></em> of our eBooks replace the old file
            and take over the old filename and etext number. The replaced older file
            is renamed. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Versions</span></em> based on separate sources are treated
            as new eBooks receiving new filenames and etext numbers.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
